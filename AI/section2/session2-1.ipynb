In simpler terms, an LM learns which word (or token) is likely to come next given the preceding text. For example, a good language model would give a higher probability to the sequence \"the cat sat on the **mat**\" than to \"the cat sat on the **banana**\" because the former is more linguistically plausible.\n","\n","<!-- At its core, an LM estimates the joint probability of a sequence of tokens $P(w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n)$.

What are Transformers\n","\n","A key development in language modeling was the introduction in 2017 of Transformers, an architecture designed around the idea of attention. This made it possible to process longer sequences by focusing on the most important part of the input, solving memory issues encountered in earlier models.\n","Transformers are the state-of-the-art architecture for a wide variety of language model applications, such as translators.\n","\n","If the input is \"I am a good dog.\", a Transformer-based translator transforms that input into the output \"Je suis un bon chien.\", which is the same sentence translated into French.\n","\n","For the task of translation, this is a text to text task and requires the full transformers to consist of an encoder and a decoder. An encoder converts input text into an intermediate representation, and a decoder converts that intermediate representation into useful text.

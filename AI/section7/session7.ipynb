It misses out on context, can't grasp relationships between data points, and often produces unreliable results. When your app needs to understand the connections between author, topic, and citations, basic RAG falls short. You can end up with hallucinations or irrelevant, unexplainable results.

Recent advancements in Vision-Language (VL) research have sparked new benchmarks for complex visual reasoning, challenging models' advanced reasoning ability. Traditional Vision-Language Models (VLMs) perform well in visual perception tasks while struggling with complex reasoning scenarios. Conversely, Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate robust text reasoning capabilities; however, they lack visual acuity. To bridge this gap, we propose Complex Visual Reasoning Large Language Models (CVR-LLM), capitalizing on VLMs' visual perception proficiency and LLMs' extensive reasoning capability. Unlike recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that require a projection layer, our approach transforms images into detailed, context-aware descriptions using an iterative self-refinement loop and leverages LLMs' text knowledge for accurate predictions without extra training.

We assert that in order to develop a foundational, first-principles understanding of the behavior and limitations of large language models, it is crucial to understand the topological and geometric structure of this token subspace. In this article, we present estimators for the dimension and Ricci scalar curvature of the token subspace, and apply it to three open source large language models of moderate size: GPT2, LLEMMA7B, and MISTRAL7B. In all three models, using these measurements, we find that the token subspace is not a manifold, but is instead a stratified manifold, where on each of the individual strata, the Ricci curvature is significantly negative. We additionally find that the dimension and curvature correlate with generative fluency of the models, which suggest that these findings have implications for model behavior. \n","title":"The structure of the token space for large language models","paperID":"86d7f3e2f550","label":"Paper"},"color":"#4CAF50","styles":{},"label":"181","scale_factor":1,"type":"#4CAF50","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":234,"properties":{"term":"dimension ricci scalar","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"234","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":235,"properties":{"term":"ambient latent space","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"235","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":236,"properties":{"term":"correlational structure","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"236","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":237,"properties":{"term":"understand topological geometric","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"237","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":238,"properties":{"term":"using measurements token","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"238","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":239,"properties":{"term":"gpt2 llemma7b mistral7b","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"239","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":240,"properties":{"term":"suggest findings implications","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"240","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":241,"properties":{"term":"instead","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"241","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":242,"properties":{"term":"apply open source","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"242","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":1136,"properties":{"venue":"","filename":"2201.11903v6.json","year":"","abstract":"\n We explore how generating a chain of thought-a series of intermediate reasoning steps-significantly improves the ability of large language models to perform complex reasoning.

In this paper, we present a collaborative game design framework that combines interactive evolution and large language models to simulate the typical human design process. We use the former to exploit users' feedback for selecting the most promising ideas and large language models for a very complex creative task-the recombination and variation of ideas. In our framework, the process starts with a brief and a set of candidate designs, either generated using a language model or proposed by the users. Next, users collaborate on the design process by providing feedback to an interactive genetic algorithm that selects, recombines, and mutates the most promising designs. We evaluated our framework on three game design tasks with human designers who collaborated remotely.

In this paper, we propose M3KE, a Massive Multi-Level Multi-Subject Knowledge Evaluation benchmark, which is developed to measure knowledge acquired by Chinese large language models by testing their multitask accuracy in zeroand few-shot settings. We have collected 20,477 questions from 71 tasks. Our selection covers all major levels of Chinese education system, ranging from the primary school to college, as well as a wide variety of subjects, including humanities, history, politics, law, education, psychology, science, technology, art and religion. All questions are multiple-choice questions with four options, hence guaranteeing a standardized and unified assessment process. We've assessed a number of state-of-theart open-source Chinese large language models on the proposed benchmark. The size of these models varies from 335M to 130B parameters. Experiment results demonstrate that they perform significantly worse than GPT-3.5 that reaches an accuracy of ∼ 48% on M3KE.

Our assessment considers two large language models, GPT-4 and Google's Bard, under various contextual scenarios across all prompting strategies. Results indicate that these models exhibit a robust understanding of key process mining abstractions, with notable proficiency in interpreting both declarative and procedural process models. In addition, we find that both models demonstrate strong performance in the object-centric setting, which could significantly propel the advancement of the object-centric process mining discipline. Additionally, these models display a noteworthy capacity to evaluate various concepts of fairness in process mining.

However, previous studies indicate that they often lack sufficient targeted information to resolve code issues. Consequently, programmers typically rely on their own research to fix errors. Historically, Stack Overflow has been the primary resource for such information, but recent advances in large language models offer alternatives. This study systematically examines 100 compiler error messages from three sources to determine the most effective approach for programmers encountering compiler errors. Factors considered include Stack Overflow search methods and the impact of model version and prompt phrasing when using large language models. The results reveal that GPT-4 outperforms Stack Overflow in explaining compiler error messages, the effectiveness of adding code snippets to Stack Overflow searches depends on the search method, and results for Stack Overflow differ significantly between Google and StackExchange API searches. Furthermore, GPT-4 surpasses GPT-3.5, with \"How to fix\" prompts yielding superior outcomes to \"What does this error mean\" prompts. These results offer valuable guidance for programmers seeking assistance with compiler error messages, underscoring the transformative potential of advanced large language models like GPT-4 in debugging and opening new avenues of exploration for researchers in AI-assisted programming. \n","title":"Addressing Compiler Errors: Stack Overflow or Large Language Models?","paperID":"4c7b505e236c","label":"Paper"},"color":"#4CAF50","styles":{},"label":"3573","scale_factor":1,"type":"#4CAF50","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":3638,"properties":{"term":"programmers encountering compiler","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"3638","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":3639,"properties":{"term":"reveal gpt","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"3639","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":3640,"properties":{"term":"google stackexchange api","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"3640","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":3641,"properties":{"term":"prompt phrasing using","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"3641","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":3642,"properties":{"term":"search method results","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"3642","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":3643,"properties":{"term":"outperforms stack overflow","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"3643","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":3644,"properties":{"term":"outcomes does error","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"3644","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":3645,"properties":{"term":"overflow primary resource","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"3645","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":3646,"properties":{"term":"adding","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"3646","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":3769,"properties":{"venue":"","filename":"2308.01776v2.json","year":"","abstract":"\n As large language models, such as GPT, continue to advance the capabilities of natural language processing (NLP), the question arises: does the problem of correction still persist?

Currently, the predominantly employed frameworks lack modular design, it often takes a lot of coding work to kickstart the training of LLM. To address this, we present \"LMTuner\", a highly usable, integrable, and scalable system for training LLMs expeditiously and with minimal user-input. LMTuner comprises three main modules -the Interaction, Training, and Inference Modules. We advocate that LMTuner's usability and integrality alleviate the complexities in training large language models.

In this response, we argue that this approach is unsuitable for evaluating general, zero-shot reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Two primary reasons underlie our objection. First, the term \"zeroshot\" implies problem sets entirely novel to GPT-3. However, the chosen approach cannot conclusively eliminate the possibility of these problems residing in the LLM's training data, as acknowledged by the authors themselves in the review file 1 . Second, the assumption underlying this approach is that tests designed for humans can accurately measure LLM capabilities. This assumption is prevalent, but remains unverified. We also provide empirical results to support our claims, see appendix (Section 7.1).

This work presents a novel geometric perspective potentially explaining universal adversarial attacks on large language models.

This hypothesis is supported by white-box model analysis comprising dimensionality reduction and similarity measurement of hidden representations.

LLMs, because of their large size and pretraining on large volumes of text data, exhibit special abilities which allow them to achieve remarkable performances without any task-specific training in many of the natural language processing tasks. The era of LLMs started with OpenAI's GPT-3 model, and the popularity of LLMs is increasing exponentially after the introduction of models like ChatGPT and GPT4. We refer to GPT-3 and its successor OpenAI models, including ChatGPT and GPT4, as GPT-3 family large language models (GLLMs). With the ever-rising popularity of GLLMs, especially in the research community, there is a strong need for a comprehensive survey which summarizes the recent research progress in multiple dimensions and can guide the research community with insightful future research directions. We start the survey paper with foundation concepts like transformers, transfer learning, self-supervised learning, pretrained language models and large language models.

We borrow from the notion of regret from online learning and empirically show that LLMs are capable of obtaining a sub-linear regret. 1 \n","title":"From Words to Numbers: Your Large Language Model Is Secretly A Capable Regressor When Given In-Context Examples","paperID":"eedbd5546e10","label":"Paper"},"color":"#4CAF50","styles":{},"label":"9479","scale_factor":1,"type":"#4CAF50","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9578,"properties":{"term":"bagging gradient boosting","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9578","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9579,"properties":{"term":"online learning","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9579","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9580,"properties":{"term":"linear regret","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9580","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9581,"properties":{"term":"llama2 gpt claude","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9581","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9582,"properties":{"term":"forest knn","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9582","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9583,"properties":{"term":"exemplars borrow notion","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9583","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9584,"properties":{"term":"updates findings reveal","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9584","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9585,"properties":{"term":"methods random","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9585","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9586,"properties":{"term":"scales number context","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9586","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9833,"properties":{"venue":"","filename":"2404.11216v2.json","year":"","abstract":"\n The performance of large language models (LLMs) is significantly influenced by the quality of the prompts provided. In response, researchers have developed enormous prompt engineering strategies aimed at modifying the prompt text to enhance task performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel technique termed position engineering, which offers a more efficient way to guide large language models. Unlike prompt engineering, which requires substantial effort to modify the text provided to LLMs, position engineering merely involves altering the positional information in the prompt without modifying the text itself. We have evaluated position engineering in two widely-used LLM scenarios: retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning (ICL). Our findings show that position engineering substantially improves upon the baseline in both cases. Position engineering thus represents a promising new strategy for exploiting the capabilities of large language models. \n","title":"Position Engineering: Boosting Large Language Models through Positional Information Manipulation","paperID":"94179531dda3","label":"Paper"},"color":"#4CAF50","styles":{},"label":"9833","scale_factor":1,"type":"#4CAF50","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":179,"properties":{"term":"offers","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"179","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9889,"properties":{"term":"prompt text enhance","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9889","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9890,"properties":{"term":"scenarios retrieval augmented","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9890","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9891,"properties":{"term":"task performance","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9891","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9892,"properties":{"term":"llms position engineering","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9892","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9893,"properties":{"term":"rag context","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9893","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9894,"properties":{"term":"termed","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9894","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9895,"properties":{"term":"way guide","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9895","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9896,"properties":{"term":"researchers developed","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"9896","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":9897,"properties":{"venue":"","filename":"2404.15660v1.json","year":"","abstract":"\n Large language models (LLMs) suffer from the hallucination problem and face significant challenges when applied to knowledge-intensive tasks. A promising approach is to leverage evidence documents as extra supporting knowledge, which can be obtained through retrieval or generation. However, existing methods directly leverage the entire contents of the evidence document, which may introduce noise information and impair the performance of large language models. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Knowledge Selection of Large Language Models (KS-LLM) method, aiming to identify valuable information from evidence documents. The KS-LLM approach utilizes triples to effectively select knowledge snippets from evidence documents that are beneficial to answering questions. Specifically, we first generate triples based on the input question, then select the evidence sentences most similar to triples from the evidence document, and finally combine the evidence sentences and triples to assist large language models in generating answers. Experimental comparisons on several question answering datasets, such as Triv-iaQA, WebQ, and NQ, demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses the baselines and achieves the best results. \n * Corresponding author Question: What star sign is Jamie Lee Curtis?

As an immediate consequence, a model may respond differently to the same prompt if asked multiple times. In this work, we argue that the evaluation and ranking of large language models should control for the randomization underpinning their functioning. Our starting point is the development of a causal model for coupled autoregressive generation, which allows different large language models to sample responses with the same source of randomness. Building upon our causal model, we first show that, on evaluations based on benchmark datasets, coupled autoregressive generation leads to the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation but using provably fewer samples. However, we further show that, on evaluations based on (human) pairwise comparisons, coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation can surprisingly lead to different rankings when comparing more than two models, even with an infinite amount of samples. This suggests that the apparent advantage of a model over others in existing evaluation protocols may not be genuine but rather confounded by the randomness inherent to the generation process. To illustrate and complement our theoretical results, we conduct experiments with several large language models from the Llama family. We find that, across multiple knowledge areas from the popular MMLU benchmark dataset, coupled autoregressive generation requires up to 40% fewer samples to reach the same conclusions as vanilla autoregressive generation. Further, using data from the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform, we find that the win-rates derived from pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model to prompts differ under coupled and vanilla autoregressive generation. 1 Tokens are the units that make up sentences and paragraphs, e.g., (sub-)words, numbers, and special end-of-sequence tokens. \n","title":"Evaluation of Large Language Models via Coupled Token Generation","paperID":"d8cf4e8086f3","label":"Paper"},"color":"#4CAF50","styles":{},"label":"12973","scale_factor":1,"type":"#4CAF50","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13071,"properties":{"term":"randomness inherent generation","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13071","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13072,"properties":{"term":"coupled autoregressive","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13072","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13073,"properties":{"term":"differently prompt asked","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13073","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13074,"properties":{"term":"derived pairwise comparisons","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13074","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13075,"properties":{"term":"surprisingly lead","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13075","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13076,"properties":{"term":"llama family","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13076","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13077,"properties":{"term":"requires 40 fewer","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13077","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13078,"properties":{"term":"using data","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13078","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13079,"properties":{"term":"arena platform","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13079","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13080,"properties":{"venue":"","filename":"2501.06286v1.json","year":"","abstract":"\n In recent years, the use of large language models (LLMs) has significantly increased, and these models have demonstrated remarkable performance in a variety of general language tasks. However, the evaluation of their performance in domain-specific tasks, particularly those requiring deep natural language understanding, has received less attention. In this research, we evaluate the ability of large language models in performing domain-specific tasks, focusing on the multi-hop question answering (MHQA) problem using the HotpotQA dataset. This task, due to its requirement for reasoning and combining information from multiple textual sources, serves as a challenging benchmark for assessing the language comprehension capabilities of these models. To tackle this problem, we have designed a two-stage selector-reader architecture, where each stage utilizes an independent LLM. In addition, methods such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and question decomposition have been employed to investigate their impact on improving the model's performance. The results of the study show that the integration of large language models with these techniques can lead to up to a 4% improvement in F1 score for finding answers, providing evidence of the models' ability to handle domain-specific tasks and their understanding of complex language. \n","title":"Bactrainus: Optimizing Large Language Models for Multihop Complex Question Answering Tasks","paperID":"459cb7680349","label":"Paper"},"color":"#4CAF50","styles":{},"label":"13080","scale_factor":1,"type":"#4CAF50","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13144,"properties":{"term":"domain specific tasks","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13144","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13145,"properties":{"term":"stage selector reader","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13145","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13146,"properties":{"term":"cot question decomposition","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13146","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13147,"properties":{"term":"problem using hotpotqa","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13147","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13148,"properties":{"term":"sources serves","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13148","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13149,"properties":{"term":"utilizes independent llm","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13149","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13150,"properties":{"term":"hop","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13150","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13151,"properties":{"term":"focusing multi","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13151","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13152,"properties":{"term":"research evaluate ability","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13152","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13153,"properties":{"venue":"","filename":"2411.19275v3.json","year":"","abstract":"\n Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating code, yet they often produce programs with flaws or deviations from intended behavior, limiting their suitability for safety-critical applications. To address this limitation, this paper introduces VECOGEN, a novel tool that combines large language models with formal verification to automate the generation of formally verified C programs. VECOGEN takes a formal specification in ANSI/ISO C Specification Language, a natural language specification, and a set of test cases to attempt to generate a verified program. This program-generation process consists of two steps. First, VECOGEN generates an initial set of candidate programs. Secondly, the tool iteratively improves on previously generated candidates. If a candidate program meets the formal specification, then we are sure the program is correct. We evaluate VECOGEN on 15 problems presented in Codeforces competitions. On these problems, VECOGEN solves 13 problems. This work shows the potential of combining large language models with formal verification to automate program generation. \n","title":"VeCoGen: Automating Generation of Formally Verified C Code with Large Language Models","paperID":"38ae57ada0c0","label":"Paper"},"color":"#4CAF50","styles":{},"label":"13153","scale_factor":1,"type":"#4CAF50","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13216,"properties":{"term":"automate program generation","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13216","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13217,"properties":{"term":"iso specification language","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13217","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13218,"properties":{"term":"safety critical","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13218","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13219,"properties":{"term":"previously generated candidates","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13219","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13220,"properties":{"term":"correct evaluate vecogen","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13220","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13221,"properties":{"term":"takes formal","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13221","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13222,"properties":{"term":"limitation paper","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13222","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13223,"properties":{"term":"13","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13223","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13224,"properties":{"term":"applications address","label":"Keyword"},"color":"#2196F3","styles":{},"label":"13224","scale_factor":1,"type":"#2196F3","size":[55,55],"position":[0,0]},{"id":13700,"properties":{"venue":"","filename":"2412.10291v1.json","year":"","abstract":"\n My paper Talking About Large Language Models has more than once been interpreted as advocating a reductionist stance towards large language models.

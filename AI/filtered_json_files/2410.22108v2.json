  "abstract": "\n Generative models such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Multimodal Large Language models (MLLMs) trained on massive web corpora can memorize and disclose individuals' confidential and private data, raising legal and ethical concerns. While many previous works have addressed this issue in LLM via machine unlearning, it remains largely unexplored for MLLMs. To tackle this challenge, we introduce Multimodal Large Language Model Unlearning Benchmark (MLLMU-Bench), a novel benchmark aimed at advancing the understanding of multimodal machine unlearning. MLLMU-Bench consists of 500 fictitious profiles and 153 profiles for public celebrities, each profile feature over 14 customized questionanswer pairs, evaluated from both multimodal (image+text) and unimodal (text) perspectives. The benchmark is divided into four sets to assess unlearning algorithms in terms of efficacy, generalizability, and model utility. Finally, we provide baseline results using existing generative model unlearning algorithms. Surprisingly, our experiments show that unimodal unlearning algorithms excel in generation and cloze tasks, while multimodal unlearning approaches perform better in classification tasks with multimodal inputs. 1 \n",

While many previous works have addressed this issue in LLM via machine unlearning, it remains largely unexplored for MLLMs. To tackle this challenge, we introduce **M**ultimodal **L**arge **L**anguage **M**odel **U**nlearning **B**enchmark (MLLMU-Bench), a novel benchmark aimed at advancing the understanding of multimodal machine unlearning. MLLMU-Bench consists of 500 fictitious profiles and 153 profiles for public celebrities, each profile feature over 14 customized question-answer pairs, evaluated from both multimodal (image+text) and unimodal (text) perspectives. The benchmark is divided into four sets to assess unlearning algorithms in terms of efficacy, generalizability, and model utility. Finally, we provide baseline results using existing generative model unlearning algorithms. Surprisingly, our experiments show that unimodal unlearning algorithms excel in generation and cloze tasks, while multimodal unlearning approaches perform better in classification tasks with multimodal inputs. 1 Footnote 1: Code is available at franicsoliu/MLLMU-Bench."

(2024); Wang et al. (2024); Tan et al. (2025); Zhang et al. (2024); Zhu et al. (2025); Diao et al. (2024), largely due to their extensive pre-training on vast copora and their exceptional general reasoning abilities. However, this powerful learning capacity can also lead to unintended consequences, such as privacy violations or copyright infringements when sensitive information is retained in the model Huang et al. (2024); Meeus et al. (2024); Karamolegkou et al. (2023). Retraining the entire model without the problematic data is straightforward but computationally prohibitive and impractical for ensuring all sensitive data is excluded. As a result, machine unlearning (MU) Nguyen et al. (2022); Liu et al. (2024) has emerged as an alternative, allowing models to \"forget\" specific data points without requiring a full retraining cycle, while also complying with legal frameworks such as the _Right to be Forgotten_Dang (2021); Bourtoule et al. (2021). To facilitate the development of unlearning in generative models, many existing works have proposed unlearning benchmarks for LLMs. For instance, TOFU Maini et al. (2024) introduces a framework that uses synthetic author data to evaluate unlearning algorithms, while WMDP Li et al. (2024) focuses on evaluating hazardous knowledge and testing unlearning methods to mitigate malicious use. However, as we shift towards MLLMs, the need for benchmarks designed to address pri \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{l r} \\hline \\hline **Statistics** & **Number** \\\\ \\hline Total Questions & 20,754 \\\\ * Image + Text Questions & 10,377 \\\\ * Pure Text Questions & 10,377 \\\\ Total Images & 1,153 \\\\ \\hline Forget Percentile & 5\\%/10\\%/15\\% \\\\ \\hline Multiple-choice Questions & 11,530 \\\\ Free Generation Questions & 4,612 \\\\ Fill-in-the-blank Questions & 4,612 \\\\ \\hline Total Profiles & 653 \\\\ * Fictitious & 500 \\\\ * Real Celeb & 153 \\\\ Total Countries & 70 \\\\ Total Regions & 240 \\\\ Total Birth Years & 211 \\\\ Total Employment & 145 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} Table 1: Key statistics of the MLLMU-Bench. vacy concerns becomes even more pressing. Existing benchmarks in MLLMs tend to focus on tasks like hallucination reduction or red teaming detection [23, 14, 15], but there remains a gap in evaluating MLLMs specifically for privacy protection through unlearning. In the context of MLLM, unlearning presents unique challenges due to the interconnected nature of knowledge across different modalities. In a unimodal setting, unlearning only textual information is insufficient compared to a multimodal approach, as the model may still retain knowledge from the visual modality. This entanglement of multimodal information complicates evaluation, making it crucial to develop benchmarks that assess the unlearning effectiveness across both visual and textual modalities. To address this challenge, we propose MLLMUBench, a fictitious unlearning benchmark for MLLMs. It features four distinct datasets: Forget Set, Test Set, Retain Set, and Real Celebrity, each designed to evaluate specific aspects of unlearning methods, including unlearning efficacy, generalizability, and model utility, across both multimodal and unimodal settings. In the multimodal setting, both the image and textual information from each individual's profile are used as unlearning inputs, while the unimodal setting relies solely on the individual's textual information. MLLMUBench consists of **20.7 K** carefully generated questions, covering 500 fictitious profiles created by GPT-4o and 153 real celebrity profiles, reviewed by human experts, used for evaluation. Additionally, MLLMUBench incorporates three levels of unlearning scenarios, targeting 5%, 10%, and 15% of the fictitious profiles, while treating the remaining 95%, 90%, and 85% as retain data. We evaluate five baseline methods across all three unlearning setups on two base MLLMs using classification, generation, and cloze tasks. From the experimental results, we observe that unimodal unlearning approaches consistently outperform multimodal ones in generation and cloze tasks for unlearning performance, while multimodal approaches perform significantly better in classification with multimodal inputs. Additionally, we find a trade-off between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across various factors, including performance on retained samples, neighboring concepts, and model general ability. In summary, our contributions are as follows: 1. We propose MLLMUBench, a privacy-preserving multimodal unlearning benchmark designed to evaluate a method's ability to remove private knowledge while maintaining model utility, focusing on Retain Set accuracy, neighbor concepts and model general ability. 2. MLLMUBench provides a comprehensive evaluation of unlearning in both multimodal and unimodal settings, highlighting the focus of each setup and the interplay between modalities in affecting unlearning performance. 3. We conduct extensive experiments with four baseline methods and one prompting technique, offering insights into the trade-offs between unlearning effectiveness and model utility, particularly the impact on general capabilities in MLLMs."

Privacy regulations like GDPR [11] and CCPA [1] enforce the _right to be forgotten_[16, 17, 18], requiring models to remove specific data upon request. A popular approach is Differential Privacy (DP) [16, 15, 14, 17], which ensures that individual user data in the training set cannot be accessed. However, these techniques are impractical for generative models due to high computational complexity and the degradation of model general ability, necessitating more efficient and targeted unlearning algorithms. **MU for Generative Models.** Many works have explored unlearning in generative models [15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. [20] first defined the setup and objective of unlearning in LLMs as generating whitespace in response to harmful prompts. To mitigate catastrophic forgetting caused by gradient ascent-based approaches [16], other works [16, 17, 18, 19] introduced task vector-basedtechniques. TOFU Maini et al. (2024) later presented a benchmark for unlearning in large language models (LLMs) using synthetic data, highlighting the need for privacy-preserving unlearning methods that ensure the removal of sensitive information while maintaining model performance. However, few works have addressed unlearning in MLLMs, where the challenge lies in removing the effect of data samples across both textual and visual modalities. Even the study Chakraborty et al. (2024) that have attempted MLLM unlearning tend to focus on textual modality, expecting that unlearning in one modality will result in knowledge removal across both."

      "text": "We introduce the MLLMU-Bench benchmark, a novel benchmark meticulously curated to assess the unlearning ability of MLLMs in the context of privacy protection, simulating real-life scenarios. The benchmark encompasses a diverse set of profiles across 70 countries, 240 regions, a wide range of birth years from the 1950s to the 2010s, and 145 distinct employment categories. Additionally, it features over 1,900 unique fun facts tailored to each individual based on their established profiles. Detailed subject coverage and statistics are provided in Figure 1. Each profile image was generated using the StyleGAN-powered Karras et al. (2019) platform ThisPersonDoesNotExist 2, ensuring all images are synthetic and free from privacy concerns. The MLLMU-Bench benchmark includes a total of 500 fictitious profiles and 153 public celebrity profiles, each accompanied by 14 questions--7 image+text questions and 7 textual questions. These questions are generated by GPT-4o based on the key attributes provided for each individual, such as residence, employment, and other personal details. The corresponding answers are then derived from the ground-truth information directly extracted from the individual's profile. This structure is mirrored in the Test Set, which includes 3.5K paraphrased questions and 500 transformed images with varied poses, modified using a Stable Diffusion-based model, Arc2Face Paraparangu et al. (2024), to assess the generalizability of unlearning algorithms. Altogether, the benchmark comprises 20k+ questions, evenly divided between image with associated text and pure text formats. The dataset is divided into the Forget Set, Retain Set, and Test Set. The Forget Set is further split into unlearning tasks that target the removal 5%, 10%, and 15% of the profiles, while the Retain Set covers the remaining 95%, 90%, and 85%. Footnote 2: We manually selected images from Kaggle. Additionally, MLLMU-Bench features 153 real celebrity profiles3, selected from CelebA dataset (Liu et al., 2015), each veri Figure 1: Demonstration of the multimodal unlearning task. MLLM is firstly fine-tuned on constructed profiles in the proposed benchmark. After fine-tuning, MLLM can answer multimodal questions related to profiles.

Finally, the performance on tasks related to the forget set and the remaining evaluation datasets are tested simultaneously. for accuracy. Same to the fictitious profile, each celebrity profile includes 14 questions--half multimodal and half pure text--ensuring a thorough evaluation across modalities.

Detailed data curation can be found in Appendix B. The generation quality is evaluated using two key metrics: **ROUGE Score:** We employ the ROUGE score to measure the longest common subsequence (LCS) between the model's generated answers and the ground-truth answers extracted from the corresponding profiles. Specifically, we compute the ROUGE-L recall score Lin (2004), which evaluates the overlap of the longest matching subsequences between the generated and reference texts, capturing both precision and recall. **Factuality Score:** Following the approach of several other benchmarks Sun et al. (2023); Yu et al. (2024); Zheng et al. (2023), we use GPT-4o as an evaluator to assess the factuality and quality of the generated answers. Given both the generated answer and the ground-truth answer, which are detailed pieces of information extracted from each person's profile, we few-shot prompted GPT-4o to score the factual accuracy of the model's output on a scale from 1 to 10. In particular, 1 indicates a non-sensical or inaccurate answer, and 10 represents a fully correct and factually consistent response. The prompted script is detailed in Appendix A.5."

Specifically, the only information provided in the Cloze-style task is the individual's name, which we assume to be the only publicly available information about the individual. We then prompt the model to complete a designated _[Blank]_ in a sentence, targeting many more details from the person's profile like residence, employment and personal hobbies. We then assess the model's response by exact matching it with the ground-truth information from individual profiles.

      "text": "To comprehensively assess model performance from various perspectives in the context of unlearning private data, we constructed a set of structured datasets designed to evaluate three critical aspects: unlearning efficacy, unlearning generalizability, and model utility. Our framework incorporates four distinct datasets: the Forget Set, Test Set, Retain Set, and Real Celebrity Set. Specifically, the Forget Set is designed to evaluate a method's unlearning efficacy, the Test Set assesses unlearning generalizability, while the Retain Set and Real Celebrity Set focus on evaluating model utility from different perspectives including retained samples and neighboring concepts. Below, we provide detailed descriptions of each dataset. **Forget Set (Unlearning Efficacy):** The Forget Set is designed to evaluate the unlearning efficacy of algorithms. In particular, Forget Set consists of selected profiles from the fine-tuning dataset, comprising either 5%, 10%, or 15% of the total 500 profiles. Each profile in this set is targeted for complete unlearning. Ideally, an effective unlearning algorithm should erase all knowledge of these individuals while preserving its performance on other data. This dataset serves as the foundation for evaluating the model's ability to forget specific knowledge without retaining fragments of it. **Test Set (Unlearning Generalizability):** The Test Set aims to evaluate the unlearning generalizability of the algorithms. Specifically, it is a transformed version of the Forget Set. For images, we use Arc2Face (Paraperas Papantoniou et al., 2024) to transform profile images by generating various poses and angles. For text, we paraphrase questions or generate new ones using GPT-4o. By altering both modalities, we assess whether the model has truly forgotten the profiles or can still recognize transformed versions, ensuring unlearning extends beyond specific data forms. **Retain Set (Model Utility):** The Retain Set includes the remaining profiles from the full dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\) that are not part of the Forget Set. After unlearning, the model is expected to retain its knowledge of these profiles with high fidelity. **Real Celebrity (Model Utility):** The Real Celebrity Set acts as a control to measure unintended consequences of unlearning. It includes real public figures in both multimodal and text-only formats. By evaluating the model's responses on this set, we ensure that unlearning fictitious profiles does not interfere with pre-trained knowledge of real-world figures. All four datasets--Forget Set, Test Set, Retain Set, and Real Celebrity Set--enable a holistic evaluation of unlearning from multiple angles, ensuring that the model not only forgets target data effectively but also maintains general performance."

In particular, the GA method applies opposite gradient updates on \\(\\mathcal{D}_{f}\\). The Gradient Difference approach extends this by introducing a balancing mechanism between \\(\\mathcal{D}_{f}\\) and the Retain Set \\(\\mathcal{D}_{r}\\), ensuring unlearning with out performance degradation. The KL Minimization technique aligns the model's predictions on \\(\\mathcal{D}_{r}\\) with those of the original model while encouraging divergence from the Forget Set. Next, the NPO treats the Forget Set \\(\\mathcal{D}_{f}\\) as dispreferred data and casts unlearning into a preference optimization framework, using an oracle model fine-tuned exclusively on the Retain Set \\(\\mathcal{D}_{r}\\).

From the table, we observe that GA and Gradient Difference, are typically more effective at unlearning the private information of each individual, often ranking first or as runner-up across all baselines. For KL Minimization and NPO, which aim to minimize the distributional distance between the base or retained model to preserve retain accuracy while maximizing unlearning, generally do not top the rankings for either unlearning effectiveness or utility. However, they offer a balanced approach by preventing significant degradation in model performance, making them suitable for cases where maintaining utility is as important as effective unlearning. Lastly, **we observe that while appending system prompts can prevent the model from generating outputs related to unlearned knowledge and maintain utility, it is less effective compared to gradient-based methods.** For example, in the LLaVA model with different forget data, the prompting method consistently ranks lowest for unlearning effectiveness on both the Forget Set and Test Set. Even in some cases with Idefics2 model, such as when using 10% forget data where it achieves decent unlearning performance, it still falls short in generalizability evaluations on the Test Set, ranking as the second-lowest method."

(2024) have discussed the trade-off between unlearning effectiveness and model utility, this question is rarely explored in the setting of multimodal. Hence, the question we aim to answer in this section is: **Does this trade-off between unlearning v.s. utility still persist in the context of MLLM unlearning?** To investigate this in detail, we break down \"model utility\" into three branches and analyze the results from three perspectives: retain accuracy, neighboring concepts (celebrity set), and model general ability including reasoning ability and helpfulness level. First, we present the trade-off analysis between unlearning effectiveness and Retain Set accuracy, shown in Figure 3(a). GA demonstrates the strongest unlearning ability, showing the largest decrease in forget accuracy compared to the vanilla model. However, this exceptional unlearning performance comes at the cost of a significant decline in retain set accuracy, likely due to the unintended removal of some retained knowledge during unlearning. In terms of preserving the model utility from the perspective of Retain Set accuracy, NPO and prompting method perform best, achieving the highest retain accuracy. We observe a similar trend on other perspectives of model utility such as neighboring concepts (i.e. Figure 3(b)), model reasoning ability (i.e. Figure 3(c)), and model helpfulness ability (i.e. Figure 3: Classification, generation, and cloze performance of the GA algorithm applied to multimodal and unimodal setups with 5% forget data, using LLaVA as the base model.

In the rest of subplots, the \\(y\\)-axis shows the classification accuracy, Rouge-L score, and cloze accuracy, respectively. The \\(x\\)-axis reflects performance across different modalities. Figure 3(d)). For example, on the Real Celebrity Set, we observe that as unlearning effectiveness improves, performance on neighboring concepts declines, as seen with the GA and Gradient Difference approaches. Lastly, we find that model reasoning ability and helpfulness are also closely tied to unlearning effectiveness as evidenced by the downward trends in Figure 3(d). **This highlights that as unlearning performance improves, it can negatively impact the model's reasoning ability and helpfulness.** The rest of the experiments are detailed in Appendix D.2."

By assessing unlearning algorithms across three key dimensions -- unlearning effectiveness, unlearning generalizability, and model utility--MLLMU-Bench provides a comprehensive framework for assessing their performance. Additionally, we conduct heuristic experiments to examine the performance of unlearning algorithms in both multimodal and unimodal setups. Our findings indicate that methods lacking a modality-aware design fail to achieve consistent unlearning performance across both multimodal and unimodal evaluation settings. Simply modifying input types to different modalities proves insufficient, often resulting in incomplete knowledge removal across modalities and unintended knowledge degradation in unimodal scenarios. These challenges highlight the need for more advanced multimodal unlearning approaches to address the inherent complexities of MLLM unlearning. Lastly, we present a systematic analysis of the trade-offs between unlearning effectiveness and model utility, offering valuable insights from multiple perspectives."

      "text": "MLLMU-Bench has several limitations. First, while we identified a performance gap between unimodal and multimodal approaches, we have only empirically shown this phenomenon without uncovering its root cause. Further analysis and exploration are needed to explain this gap. Second, to better simulate real-world scenarios, it would be important to generate group images where the forget target is present. This would allow a more precise evaluation of knowledge disentanglement between unlearned and retained information. Third, our benchmark targets the removal of all information related to an individual, such as name, age, and residence, assuming that a person's name is public information from which other details can be inferred. In the future, it would be beneficial to selectively unlearn specific key attributes (e.g., residence) while preserving other details. Lastly, as noted in recent work Shumailov et al. (2024), unlearned models may relearn forgotten data through in-context learning (ICL). Therefore, it is an interesting direction to investigate methods to prevent unlearned models from reacquiring this data, which we leave for future work. We provide a detailed analysis on possible future directions in Appendix F."

      "title": "Unlearning Efficacy",
      "text": "Unlearning efficacy refers to the model's ability to completely erase specific knowledge about the targeted data, ensuring that it behaves as if the data had never been part of the training process. To evaluate this, we focus on the Forget Set, where the model is expected to unlearn all information associated with selected profiles. The challenge here lies in ensuring that the model not only forgets the factual content of these profiles but also any latent representations or implicit associations formed during training. In our framework, unlearning efficacy is measured by the model's performance in both multimodal (image+text) and text-only settings. Specifically, the model is evaluated on a set of multiple-choice questions, where it must avoid selecting the correct answer associated with a forgotten profile. Formally, given a question \\(x\\) and a set of possible answers \\(Y\\), the model should minimize the probability of selecting the correct answer \\(y^{*}\\in Y\\) from the Forget Set: \\[\\hat{y}=\\arg\\max_{y\\in Y}P(y\\mid x,M_{\\text{u}})\\quad\\text{where}\\quad y\\neq y ^{*},\\] where \\(M_{\\text{u}}\\) represents the model after unlearning. An ideal model will treat the forgotten profiles as unknown, exhibiting behavior indistinguishable from random guessing. Additionally, we employ generation and cloze tasks to further assess unlearning efficacy. In generation task, the model generates descriptions or answers related to forgotten profiles. If the generated output contains factual inconsistencies or a lack of information about the forgotten profile, the unlearning process is considered effective (Yao et al., 2024; Pan et al., 2023). This ensures that the model has thoroughly forgotten both explicit knowledge and nuanced associations. Additionally, in cloze tasks, the model is provided with the person's name and part of the context, such as a portion of the residence country, and is asked to fill in the blank with the target answer based on the given information."

      "title": "Unlearning Generalizability",
      "text": "Unlearning generalizability refers to the model's ability to extend its unlearning to altered representations of the forgotten data, ensuring that knowledge removal is not limited to the original form of the data but generalizes across different variations (Liu et al., 2024). This is particularly important as models often form robust associations that allow them to recognize paraphrased or transformed versions of the original content (Shayegani et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2024). To assess this, we evaluate the model's performance on the Test Set, which consists of transformations of the samples in the Forget Set. These transformations include modifications to both the image and text modalities. For image transformations, we use a stable-diffusion based model named Arc2Face to modify the pose of individuals. For the textual modality, we either paraphrase the original question from the Forget Set or use GPT-4o to generate new questions based on the target person's profile that were not present in the Forget Set. The model's ability to unlearn across such variations demonstrates a more comprehensive and thorough forgetting process (Liu et al., 2024). Formally, for each transformed input \\(z^{\\prime}=\\langle\\text{image}^{\\prime},x^{\\prime},y^{\\prime}\\rangle\\), where \\(x^{\\prime}\\) is a paraphrased version of the original question and image\\({}^{\\prime}\\) is a modified version of the original image, the model should minimize the probability of retrieving the correct answer \\(y^{*}\\): \\[\\hat{y}^{\\prime}=\\arg\\max_{y\\neq y^{*}}P(y\\mid\\text{image}^{\\prime},x^{\\prime},M_{\\text{u}})\\] This ensures that the unlearning process is robust and that the model does not retain latent traces of the forgotten knowledge in modified forms. Additionally, by evaluating both multimodal (image+text) and text-only setups, we closely align our approach with real-life scenarios, where data may appear in different formats and contexts, requiring the model to effectively forget across all representations."

We assess model utility across several dimensions using the Retain Set, Real Celebrity Set, and additional reasoning benchmarks. The Retain Set consists of the remaining profiles from the fine-tuning dataset, excluding those in the Forget Set, and is designed to evaluate the model's performance on unrelated samples.

      "text": "To simulate a real-life scenario where unlearning algorithms are applied to a \"pre-trained\" model, we first fine-tune the off-the-shelf MLLM model using information exacted from the fictitious profiles. Specifically, for each profile, we use GPT-4o to generate descriptions based on the person's key attributes, and these descriptions are used as the fine-tuning data for the base model. The fine-tuning process involves pairing visual inputs (images of the individuals) with textual information (questions and answers), allowing the model to learn associations between these modalities. For each input \\(\\langle\\text{image},x,y\\rangle\\), where image is the visual representation of the individual, \\(x\\) is the question, and \\(y\\) is the ground-truth answer, the model is trained to predict the answer \\(\\hat{y}\\). The loss function for a single sample is defined as the negative log-likelihood (NLL) over the answer tokens: \\[\\ell(x,y,w)=\\frac{1}{|y|}\\sum_{i=1}^{|y|}\\text{NLL}_{w}\\left(y_{i}\\mid[x,y_{< i},\\text{image}]\\right),\\] where \\(w\\) represents the model parameters, and the loss is averaged over all tokens in the answer sequence \\(y\\). The overall objective during fine-tuning is to minimize the average loss across the entire dataset \\(\\mathcal{D}\\), expressed as: \\[L(\\mathcal{D},w)=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{D}|}\\sum_{(x,y)\\in\\mathcal{D}}\\ell(x,y,w).\\] After fine-tuning, the model represents the \"vanilla\" version, which serves as the starting point for subsequent unlearning experiments."

For the Retain and Forget Sets, human experts selected images generated by the ThisPersonDoesNotExist platform 4, verifying that all semantic features, such as facial clarity and integrity, were intact. Images with noise, artifacts, or inconsistencies were excluded. Experts also ensured that each image accurately matched the corresponding profile's biographical information. For all generated questions, experts manually reviewed and validated the answers to ensure alignment with the information in the profiles. Footnote 4: We manually selected images from Kaggle. In the Test Set, images were modified using a stable-diffusion-based model, Arc2Face [1], to transform subjects into different poses. Experts ensured that the generated images remained consistent with the original individuals, preserving key characteristics to closely resemble the original image. This validation was crucial for evaluating unlearning generalizability without introducing ambiguities. For the Real Celebrity Set, human experts cross-checked the profiles' biographical data with trusted sourceslike Wikipedia, ensuring accuracy across all questions and images. This thorough quality control process guarantees reliable, accurate data for testing multimodal unlearning algorithms in MLLMU-Bench. Additionally, all celebrity images in our benchmark are selected from the publicly available CelebA Dataset Liu et al. (2015), which is explicitly intended for non-commercial research purposes. Specifically, CelebA contains over 200K celebrity images, from which we randomly selected 153 images, ensuring they are clear and recognizable.

For each sample \\(x\\in\\mathcal{D}_{f}\\), we aim to maximize the loss, encouraging the model to deviate from its initial predictions.

In particular, the NPO loss function is defined as follows: \\[\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{NPO}}=\\frac{2}{\\beta}\\mathbb{E}_{(x,y)\\in D_{\\text{f}}} \\left[\\log\\left(1+\\left(\\frac{\\pi_{\\theta}(y|x)}{\\pi_{\\text{ref}}(y|x)} \\right)^{\\beta}\\right)\\right]\\] where \\(\\pi_{\\theta}(y|x)\\) represents the prediction probability of the current model for token \\(y\\) given the input \\(x\\) [MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17] tain Set. Upon analyzing the incorrect responses in the Retain Set, we observe that current unlearning methods struggle to differentiate closely related concepts within a specific profile. For instance, in Figure 24, when asked about the graduated college of a person from the Retain Set, the vanilla model provides the correct answer. However, after unlearning with some methods (e.g., GA), the model gives a response that is close but incorrect, such as answering \"University of British Columbia\" due to the person residing in Vancouver, even though it is not their graduated school. A similar error occurs in Figure 22, where the unlearned model provides an incorrect answer related to another piece of information about the person (e.g., their birthplace). These examples highlight the difficulty and importance of selectively removing the target concept during unlearning without affecting other relevant knowledge. Lastly, for the cloze test, we observe that it presents a unique challenge to the unlearned model, as it usually fails to follow the instruction and fill in the blank correctly."

      "title": "Why Not Just Unimodal Unlearning?",
      "text": "In section 5, we found that the unimodal approach can outperform the multimodal approach in both multimodal (i.e., image with associated text as input) and unimodal (i.e., text-only input) setups on tasks other than classification. Hence, a natural question arises: **Why not exclusively use unimodal unlearning approaches, given their superior unlearning performance compared to multimodal methods?** To answer this, we note that although the unimodal approach demonstrates better unlearning effectiveness, it shows poorer utility performance on the Retain Set and Real Celebrity Set. In the discussion section, even with careful hyperparameter tuning, unimodal GA exhibits a faster rate of collapse compared to multimodal GA, making it challenging to balance unlearning effectiveness and model utility. This tendency is also observed in other more balanced approaches like NPO and KL Minimization, as shown in Appendix D. This phenomenon is expected because the textual modality plays a central role in decision-making within multimodal language models Liu et al. (2024); Tsimpoukelli et al. (2021), meaning that unlearning has greater impacts on retained knowledge and the model's general abilities, such as reasoning and instruction following. Unlearning in textual modality alone may not comprehensively remove the targeted knowledge and could inadvertently impair performance on tasks requiring multimodal comprehension. Hence, achieving **selective** unlearning within MLLMs is more challenging with unimodal approaches alone, as they can disrupt the balance between unlearning effectiveness and utility across modalities. **This highlights the necessity and importance of developing more crafted multimodal unlearning approaches to achieves a better balance performance with respects to both unlearning objectives and utility across all modalities.**"

      "title": "Potential Mllmu-Bench Improvements",
      "text": "MLLMU-Bench uses the Test Set to assess the robustness of the unlearned model with transformed profile images and paraphrased questions. Various attack techniques could be employed to further test the robustness of unlearning methods for MLLMs. For example, Carlini et al. (2021) evaluated the robustness of LLMs by performing a training data extraction attack to recover trained examples, while Niu et al. (2024) focused on jailbreaking MLLMs to generate objectionable responses to harmful user queries. Consequently, similar attack methods could be adopted to further evaluate the robustness of unlearning methods for MLLMs. Secondly, we encourage researchers to also shift their focus to designs with **certified unlearning** for MLLMs, as the unlearning field--especially in generative models--lacks such work. This shift could further improve the reliability and robustness of unlearning methods. * **Reverance and Detail**: * More detail does not always improve the score; added details should be factually relevant. * If the generated response contains excessive or irrelevant details (e.g., adding personal information when only appearance is requested), lower the score accordingly. - **Task Type: {task_type.capitalize()}** - **Image ID: {image_id}** - **Question**: {question} - **Generated Answer**: {generated_answer} - **Ground Truth**: {ground_truth} Please evaluate the factuality of the generated response based on the rubric above, and return a score (1-10) along with a short justification.

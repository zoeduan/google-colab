      "text": "The recent advancement of natural language processing is currently being exemplified by the large language model (LLMs) such as GPT-3 [1], PaLM [2], Galactica [3] and LLaMA [4]. The models have been trained on large amount of text-data and are able to answer questions, generate coherent text and complete most language related tasks. LLMs have been touted to have impact in domains such as climate science [5], health [6] and education [7]. In education, it has been suggested that they can be exploited to boost learning in different categories such as in elementary school children, middle and high school children, university students etc [8]. This is line with a long-time goal of AI to develop conversational agents that can support teachers in guiding children through reading material such as reading storybooks [9][10]. Normally, in reading a text such as children's storybook, a teacher is expected to guide the children through the text and periodically gauge their understanding by posing questions from the text. The key concept in guided reading is the ability to use questions to gauge understanding and encourage deeper thinking about the material being read. In a teacher led guided reading, apart from gauging understanding, questions can be used to identify children's support needs and enable the teacher to direct attention to the critical content. To achieve the full benefits of guided reading, the teacher is supposed to ask wide variety of questions ranging from low to high cognitive challenge questions [11]. Low cognitive challenge questions are constrained to short answers while high cognitive challenge questions require explanations, evaluation or extension of text [11]. The use of questions to foster understanding and learning from text is well established across a range of age groups and learning contexts [11]. It is therefore of interest to gauge the effectiveness of LLMs to perform the tasks involved in guided reading. For LLMs to be viewed as potential support agents for teachers or even stand-alone tools that can help in guided reading, they must be able to: generate meaningful questions and answers from the text, generate diverse questions both in terms of content coverage and difficulty of questions and identify the support needs for the students. In thiswork, we investigate the suitability of ChatGPT 1 and Bard 2 to act as a storybook reading guide for children. Specifically, we evaluate them on the following issues: Footnote 1: [https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) Footnote 2: [https://bard.google.com/](https://bard.google.com/) 1. Ability to generate content related questions and answers from a given input text i.e., its performance in question-answer generation(QAG) task. 2. Ability to generate both low and high cognitive demand questions. 3. Ability to generate diverse questions i.e., questions that cover almost all topics in each story. 4. Ability to recommend areas that a student needs to focus on based on wrong responses from the student 5. Compare their performance to the currently existing AI-based tools for educational question generation."

      "text": "Question generation tools seek to accept input text and generate meaningful questions that are extracted from the text. Existing question generation tools can be categorised into two i.e., rule-based tools and neural based tools [12]. Rule based tools such as [13] and [14] exploit manually crafted rules to extract questions from text. Neural based techniques implement an end-to-end architecture that follow attention-based sequence-to-sequence framework [15]. The sequence-to-sequence frameworks are mainly composed of two key parts i.e., the encoder which learns a joint representation of the input text and the decoder which generates the questions[12]. Currently, both the joint representation learning, and question generation are implemented by attention-based framework [16]. Work in [17] introduced the attention-based sequence-to-sequence architecture to generate question from the input sentence. The encoder was implemented via RNN to accept an input text and learn its representation. Its output is fed into the decoder which generates a related question. The decoder exploits attention mechanism to assign more weight to the most relevant part of the text. Other question asking tools that implement attention-based sequence-to sequence framework include [18], [19] and [20]. Although these neural based tools have a common high-level encoder-decoder structure, their low-level implementations of different aspects of question generation differ significantly [12]. While these tools are generally developed for question generation, there are tool such as [9] and [10] which target question generation for educational purposes. The use of questions in guided reading has been widely studied [21][22][23]. Questions are used during guided reading to evaluate understanding, encourage deeper thinking about the text and to scaffold understanding of challenging text [11]. It has been suggested in [8] that large language models can play a significant role in boosting education of different levels of children. It is therefore important to evaluate them if indeed they are fit for purpose in which they are being deployed in. In this work we evaluate their ability to participate in guided reading and specifically, evaluate their question generation ability. Are they able to follow the general trend of a human teacher in asking question during comprehension reading?"

      "text": "LLMs must demonstrate that they have the potential for an in-depth understanding of a given input text for them to be deployed as reading guides. One indicator of input text's comprehension is the ability to generate meaningful questions and answers from the input text. Formally, given a passage \\(P\\), the model should be able to generate a set of questions \\(\\{q_{1},\\cdots,q_{n}\\}\\) and their respective answers \\(\\{q_{1},\\cdots,q_{n}\\}\\). Both the set of questions and answers should be retrieved from the passage \\(P\\). Perhaps one of the greatest powers of LLMs such as ChatGPT is the ability to respond to questions posed to it on-the-fly. However, it is unclear to what extent they can connect different aspect of input stories to generate both low cognitive questions and questions that require inference to be answered (i.e., high cognitive demand questions). Moreover,how will it exploit the vast amount of knowledge it acquired during training to boost its question asking ability? Further, will it be able to generate answers from the input text without being \"confused\" by its internal knowledge. We are interested in evaluating the ability of LLMs to ask meaningful questions that can be solely answered from the input story. We are also interested to evaluate how accurate LLMs are in answering the questions when solely relying on its understanding of the input text. To do this, we prompt a given LLM to generate questions based on an input story (see fig 1). The generated questions are automatically evaluated by comparing their semantic similarity to a set of baseline questions. To evaluate the performance of a given LLM on question generation, we exploit the popularly used metrics in question generation task which include ROUGE-L [24] and BERTScore [25] and compare the semantic similarity of questions generated with the baseline questions. The similarity between LLM generated questions and reference questions is evaluated by concatenating the generated questions into one sentence and compare it with similarly concatenated reference questions ( see [10] which uses a similar approach)."

      "title": "Question Diversity",
      "text": "To test the student's understanding of a given text being read, questions must be generated that cover nearly all the sections of the story. We are interested in evaluating the ability of ChatGPT and Bard to generate questions that are not biased towards a given section of the text. Concretely, we are seeking to quantify the variation of the questions being generated by LLMs. We hypothesize that the more diverse the questions are, the more exhaustive the questions cover the different topics in the input text. This will give us an idea on suitability of LLMs to generate questions that cover the whole content being read. In machine learning, several entropy reliant techniques have been proposed to evaluate diversity of dataset. Research in [26] proposes Inception Score (IS) to evaluate the synthetic samples generated by a Generative Adversarial model(GAN),(\\(G\\))[27]. The intuition behind IS is that the conditional label distribution \\(P(y\\mid x)\\) of images generated by GAN is projected to have low Figure 1: Prompting LLM to generate questions from a given text input. label entropy i.e., the generated images belong to few classes while entropy across the images should be high that is the marginal distribution \\(\\int p(y\\mid x=G(z))dz\\) should have high entropy. To capture this intuition, they suggest the metric in equation 1. \\[exp(\\mathbb{E}_{x}KL(p(z\\mid x)\\parallel p(y))) \\tag{1}\\] Another popular metric that provides a measure of diversity on synthetically generated samples is the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) score [28]. This is a metric that considers location and ordering of the data along the function space. Taking the activations of the penultimate layer of a given model to represent features of a given dataset \\(x\\) and considering only the first two moments i.e., the mean and covariance, the FID assumes that the coding units of the model \\(f(x)\\) follow a multi-dimensional Gaussian, therefore have maximum entropy distribution for a given mean and covariance. If the model \\(f(x)\\),generates embeddings with mean and covariance (m,C) given the synthetic data \\(p(.)\\) and \\((m_{w},C_{w})\\) for real data \\(p_{w}(.)\\), then FID is defined as: \\[d^{2}((m,C),(m_{w},C_{w})=||m-m_{w}||_{2}^{2}+Tr(C+c_{w}-2(CC_{w})^{1/2}) \\tag{2}\\] Other metrics that have been proposed to evaluate diversity, include precision and recall metrics [29][30]. One major problem with these metrics is that they assume existence of reference samples where the generated samples can be compared to [30]. In our case, we seek to evaluate the diversity of the questions generated without comparing to any reference questions. To achieve this, we use Vendi score (VS), a metric proposed for diversity evaluation in the absence of reference data. VS is defined as \\[VS(X)=exp(-\\sum_{i}^{s}\\lambda_{i}log\\lambda_{i}) \\tag{3}\\] Here \\(X=\\{x_{i},\\cdots,x_{n}\\}\\) is the input data whose diversity is to be evaluated. \\(\\lambda_{i},i=\\{1,\\cdots,n\\}\\) are the eigenvalues of a positive semidefinite matrix \\(K/n\\) whose entries are \\(K_{ij}=k(x_{i},x_{j})\\) where \\(k\\) is a positive semidefinite similarity function with \\(k(x,x)=1\\) for all \\(x\\). This metric which is like effective rank [31] seeks to quantify the geometric transformation induced by performing a linear mapping of a vector \\(x\\) from a vector space \\(R^{n}\\) to \\(R^{m}\\) by a matrix \\(A\\) i.e \\(Ax\\). Normally, the number of dimensions retained by a linear transformation \\(Ax\\) is captured by the rank of the matrix \\(A\\). The rank however is silent on the shape induced by the transformation. Effective rank introduced by [31] seeks to capture the shape that results due to the linear mapping. Effective rank therefore can be used to capture the spread of data hence ideal to measure diversity. To compute the diversity of questions generated by the two LLMs, we execute the following steps: 1. Prompt the LLM to generate a set of questions \\(Q\\) given an input text. 2. Replicate the set \\(Q_{1}=\\{q_{1},\\cdots,q_{n}\\}\\) to get a copy of the questions \\(Q_{2}=\\{q_{1},\\cdots,q_{n}\\}\\). Designate \\(Q_{1}\\) as the reference set and \\(Q_{2}\\) as the candidate set. 3. Pass the set \\(Q_{1}\\) and \\(Q_{2}\\) through the BERTScore 3to extract the cosine similarity matrix \\(K\\). 4. Use the VS package4 to extract the VS score diversity value. Footnote 3: [https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score](https://github.com/Tiiiger/bert_score) 5. Compare the VS score diversity value to human generated diversity score"

      "title": "Ability To Generate Questions That Differ In Difficulty",
      "text": "On top of generating questions that cover the whole content, it is desirable for LLMs to generate wide range of questions from low to high cognitive challenge questions. This will make students to answer questions that address all the cognitive domains. Low cognitive question mostly requires short answers which require affirmation or not (e.g. \"Did the queen have golden hair?\"). Conversely high cognitive challenge questions require explanations, evaluations and some speculations on the extension of text [11](e.g., \"Why did the king's advisors fail to find the right wife for him?\"). The purpose of low cognitive challenge questions is to evaluate the basic understanding of the text by the students and ease them into the study interaction [11]. However, they have the potential of promoting over-dominance of teachers. On the other hand, high cognitive questions foster greater engagement of the students, generate inferential responses and promote better comprehension of the reading material [11]. In [11], the two categories of questions are differentiated by exploiting the syntactic structure of the question. The high cognitive challenge questions are signalled by wh-word i.e., questions that use words such as what, why, how, or when. These questions are also composed of a continuum of high to low challenge questions. Specifically, wh-pronoun and wh-determinat questions that start with who, whom, whoever, what, which, whose, whichever and whatever require low challenge literal responses. However, the wh-adverb questions such how, why, where, and when are more challenging since they require more abstract and inferential responses involving explanation of causation and evaluation (e.g., \"Why was the king sad?\"; \"How did the king's daughter receive the news of her marriage?\"). The low cognitive challenge questions are generally non wh-word questions. It has been suggested in [21][32] that teachers should generally seek to ask high challenge questions as opposed to low challenge questions whenever possible. In our case we seek to establish the types of questions preferred by the two LLMs based on their level of challenge. To evaluate this, we adopt three categories of questions i.e., confirmative, explicit and implicit. Explicit are non-confirmative questions that require low challenge literal responses i.e., where answers can be retrieved from the text without much inference while implicit are questions that require inferential responses. To evaluate the type of questions generated, we employ the following steps: 1. Given a paragraph of text we prompt the LLM to generate questions based on the text. 2. We provide the questions generated to human evaluators and ask them to read the text and answer the questions. 3. Human evaluators then annotate each question whether it is confirmative, explicit and implicit. 4. For each question, we select the most popular annotation i.e., annotation where most evaluators agree. 5. We compute percentages of each category."

While it was difficult to design an evaluation on LLMs that can uncover students' weaknesses based on their responses, we resorted to evaluate their ability to recommend part of text where the student needs to re-read based on the responses provided to the questions. Basically, we evaluate the ability of a LLM to detect part of the text that the student did not understand. This we believe plays some part in diagnosing student's need. To perform our evaluation, we execute the following steps: 1. We pass a three-paragraph text to a large language model and prompt it to generate questions from the text. 2. We annotate the generated questions based on the paragraph in which they were extracted from i.e \\(<p_{i},q_{i}>\\) where \\(p_{i}\\) is the paragraph \\(i=1,2,3\\) and \\(q_{i}\\) are the questions \\(i=1,\\cdots,n\\), linked to paragraph \\(p_{i}\\). 3. We prompt the large language model to answer all the questions generated. We then deliberately alter a set of answers belonging to questions from a given paragraph to be wrong. All the answers from other two paragraphs remain as generated by the LLM. 4. We then prompt LLM to evaluate all the answers( for all the questions) generated in the previous step. 5. We prompt LLMs to suggest the section of the text that the student did not comprehend based on the responses in the previous step. 6. We compute the BERTScore between the recommended text and the paragraph which had all question altered to be wrong."

We only used the 46 storybooks which are contained in the test and validation set. This is to enable direct comparison with baseline models which also use the two sets. Table 2 also shows the performance of the baseline models. Based on the results, both ChatGPT and Bard register a slight performance advantage in their f-measure values. The lack of significant advantage of LLMs over the baseline models is surprising given the high quality of questions they generated based on human evaluation. We hypothesise that the evaluation based on matching of similar tokens (used in ROUGE-L ) may not be ideal for this set-up since both ChatGPT and Bard were trained using very large text datasets that have extensive vocabularies, therefore they have a wide space of vocabularies to use while asking a question. Hence some of their vocabulary's choices may not be present in the reference questions. Table 1 shows some examples where the questions are semantically similar, but Rouge-L values are low. Furtherunlike baseline models, ChatGPT and Bard were not trained exclusively on FairytaleQA dataset question-answer pair, hence their style of asking questions may be significantly different from the reference questions. However, the superiority of LLMs is demonstrated when using BERTScore metric. Here, they outperform the baseline models in precision, recall and f-measure values. Their superior performance demonstrates that LLMs are able to generate meaningful educational questions that mimic how a human-teacher would ask questions."

We use these 46 books to evaluate if ChatGPT and Bard can cover all the subtopics of a storybook while asking questions. To do this we use the evaluation criteria described in section 3.2. Question-topic diversity is evaluated on per book basis. For a given book, we generate questions by passing one or merged paragraphs and a prompt into a large language model. We iterate through all the paragraphs of the book and aggregate generated questions into a set Q. We then replicate the questions to get another set \\(Q^{{}^{\\prime}}\\). BERTScore is then exploited to generate the similarity matrix \\(K\\). The established matrix \\(K\\) is used to compute VS value for that book. To get an idea of how a given large language model generates diverse questions, we average the VS values over the 46 books. We also engage human annotators to annotate FairytaleQA reference questions based on the 46 books. The annotators are supposed to label each question with the sub-topic that the question addresses. We do not restrict the possible topics but allow annotators to come up with their own based on reading the storybooks excerpts and the questions. Annotations are adopted by majority. From human evaluators, we generated an average diversity score of 66.8 from the 46 excerpts of the storybooks. The question-topic diversity results are shown in table 3,4 and 5.

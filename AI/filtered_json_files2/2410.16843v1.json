  "abstract": "\n Trustworthiness is an essential prerequisite for the real-world application of large language models. In this paper, we focus on the trustworthiness of language models with respect to retrieval augmentation. Despite being supported with external evidence, retrieval-augmented generation still suffers from hallucinations, one primary cause of which is the conflict between contextual and parametric knowledge. We deem that retrievalaugmented language models have the inherent capabilities of supplying response according to both contextual and parametric knowledge. Inspired by aligning language models with human preference, we take the first step towards aligning retrievalaugmented language models to a status where it responds relying merely on the external evidence and disregards the interference of parametric knowledge. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning based algorithm TRUSTWORTHY-ALIGNMENT, theoretically and experimentally demonstrating large language models' capability of reaching a trustworthy status without explicit supervision on how to respond. Our work highlights the potential of large language models on exploring its intrinsic abilities by its own and expands the application scenarios of alignment from fulfilling human preference to creating trustworthy agents. Our code is available at  https://github.com/zmzhang2000/  trustworthy-alignment . \n",

In this paper, we focus on the trustworthiness of language models with respect to retrieval augmentation. Despite being supported with external evidence, retrieval-augmented generation still suffers from hallucinations, one primary cause of which is the conflict between contextual and parametric knowledge. We deem that retrieval-augmented language models have the inherent capabilities of supplying response according to both contextual and parametric knowledge. Inspired by aligning language models with human preference, we take the first step towards aligning retrieval-augmented language models to a status where it responds relying merely on the external evidence and disregards the interference of parametric knowledge. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning based algorithm Trustworthy-Alignment, theoretically and experimentally demonstrating large language models' capability of reaching a trustworthy status without explicit supervision on how to respond. Our work highlights the potential of large language models on exploring its intrinsic abilities by its own and expands the application scenarios of alignment from fulfilling human preference to creating trustworthy agents.

      "text": "Recent advancement in Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly boosted the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems across a wide range of fields, such as dialogue assistants (OpenAI, 2023) and autonomous agents (Wang et al., 2023). Researchers contend that one of the most powerful LLMs, _i.e.,_ GPT-4, could reasonably be viewed as a spark of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) considering its capabilities in language, vision, mathematics, coding, _etc_(Bubeck et al., 2023). Despite these remarkable capabilities, the lack of trustworthiness is still a challenging obstacle to the application of LLMs. As probabilistic models, LLMs occasionally generate output which is plausible but deviating from source input (Adlakha et al., 2023) or factual knowledge (Min et al., 2023; Muhlgay et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023). This phenomenon is referred to as _hallucination_(Maynez et al., 2020; Ji et al., 2023), which poses tangible risks to real-world application scenarios with low tolerance of error such as medical diagnosis (Nori et al., 2023) and legal consultation (Cui et al., 2023; Nguyen, 2023). A common and straightforward approach to mitigate hallucinations in LLMs is to leverage non-parametric knowledge source through _Retrieval-Augmented Generation_(RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020; Shuster et al., 2021). Specifically, RAG retrieves supporting evidence relevant to the source input from an external knowledge base through a retriever, and generates the output conditioning on both the source input and retrieved evidence. The retrieve-and-generate paradigm proves to significantly enhance the factuality and reliability of LLMs (Lewis et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2021; Lazaridou et al., 2022). However, incorporating retrieval into language generation encounters a new problem of _knowledge conflicts_(Longpre et al., 2021) that still impedes the progress towards trustworthy language models. LLMs commonly learn from massive unsupervised data during pre-training and store the learned knowledge in their parameters. Conflict emerges as contextual knowledge in the retrieved evidence contrasting with the inner knowledge stored in LLMs' parameters, which triggers \"hallucinations\" if an LLM holds a strongbelief in its parametric knowledge and produces response inconsistent with the provided context. This phenomenon is unexpected as the performance of RAG will be restricted by hallucinations if the retrieved evidence is not accurate and helpful enough (Karpukhin et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023; Mallen et al., 2023). We focus our research on the retrieval-augmented generation setting where an LLM is deemed trustworthy if it answers questions based on contextual rather than parametric knowledge. A wealth of studies (Longpre et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Neeman et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023) has been dedicated to this problem owing to its obstructive impact on trustworthy LLMs. These efforts have discovered LLMs' dilemma between the parameters and retrieved evidence. In other words, LLMs may have capabilities of responding according to both contextual and parametric knowledge, and struggles to determine which to rely on. The inherent capabilities conforms to the foundation of a recently emerged technology in the field of AI: _alignment_(Ji et al., 2023), which aims at encouraging a instruction-following language model (Wei et al., 2022) to behave in line with human intentions and values (Leike et al., 2018) by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022). It is worth noting that alignment only \"unlocks\" capabilities LLMs already had, but does not teach new capabilities to the pre-trained and instruction-tuned models (Lowe and Leike, 2022). Inspired by the success of aligning LLMs with human intentions and values, we take the first step towards aligning retrieval-augmented LLM to a trustworthy status where it supplies responses in accordance with merely the retrieved evidence and ignores the parametric knowledge. We hypothesize that LLMs have tendencies of generating response in line with both contextual and parametric knowledge. Based on this, we address the problem of knowledge conflicts by aligning retrieval-augmented LLMs to trustworthy status via reinforcement learning (**Trustworthy-Alignment**). In particular, we elaborate our work by answering the following research questions: * _Does the hypothesis hold that retrieval-augmented LLMs have inherent capabilities of responding according to both contextual and parametric knowledge?_ (Section 2) * _How can we design an algorithm that enhances the trustworthiness of retrieval-augmented LLMs by aligning them to a trustworthy status via reinforcement learning?_ (Section 3) * _How does the proposed algorithm perform and what are the side effects of aligning retrieval-augmented LLMs to trustworthy status?_ (Section 4) We demonstrate that when _merely providing what to achieve_, retrieval-augmented LLMs are capable of aligning itself to a status where it furnishes responses only relying on the contextual knowledge _without explicit supervision on how to respond_. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs on exploring its intrinsic capabilities by its own and expands the application scenarios of alignment from fulfilling human intention and values to creating trustworthy agents."

      "text": "A language model is a parametric probabilistic model \\(\\pi_{\\theta}\\) conditioned on the input text. This paper focuses on the question answering (QA) task where the input text is a question \\(q\\). The generation process is then formulated as sampling a response \\(y\\) from the language model: \\[y\\sim\\pi_{\\theta}(y|q)=\\prod_{t=0}^{T-1}\\pi_{\\theta}(y_{t}|q,y_{<t}), \\tag{1}\\] where both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) are sequences of tokens, \\(t\\) is the token index, and \\(T\\) is the token number of the response. Under the retrieval-augmented setting, we have an additional context \\(c\\) as a supporting evidence for answering the question, which is typically retrieved from a large knowledge base, _e.g._, Wikipedia. Following Brown et al. (2020), we formulate the retrieval-augmented generation task by reformatting the question \\(q\\) and context \\(c\\) as a natural language instruction using a prompting function \\(f(q,c)\\): \\[y\\sim\\pi_{\\theta}(y|q,c)=\\prod_{t=0}^{T-1}\\pi_{\\theta}(y_{t}|f(q,c),y_{<t}). \\tag{2}\\]"

However, the reality falls short of expectations since we have no idea whether the contextual knowledge in \\(c\\) or the parametric knowledge in \\(\\theta\\) contributes more to LLM's decision. The _knowledge conflict_(Longpre et al., 2021) emerges when contextual knowledge diverges from the parametric knowledge. We simulate knowledge conflicts by constructing counterfactual data following the entity substitution framework in Longpre et al. (2021). Specifically, we have an original triplet \\((q,c^{o},y^{o})\\), where \\(y^{o}\\) is the original right answer of question \\(q\\) and is included in the context \\(c^{o}\\) so that it can be inferred from \\(q\\) and \\(c^{o}\\). For each sample, we detect the corresponding entity of \\(y^{o}\\) and replace it with a another entity \\(y^{s}\\) of the same type. Meanwhile, \\(c^{o}\\) is transformed to a new context \\(c^{s}\\) by replacing all of the answer entity mentions. We expect the language model to supply a response including the substituted answer \\(y^{s}\\) given the counterfactual context \\(c^{s}\\)."

      "title": "Tendency Analysis",
      "text": "To validate the prerequisite of our work that retrieval-augmented LLMs have tendencies of delivering response according to both the contextual and parametric knowledge, we conduct tendency analysis on multiple prevalent pre-trained LLMs. For a specific question \\(q\\) and the counterfactual context \\(c^{s}\\), we construct three candidate responses: the substituted answer \\(y^{s}\\), the original answer \\(y^{o}\\) and a none response \\(y^{n}\\) instantiated as \"None of the above\". Then we format the question answering problem to a multi-choice task where LLM selects the best response from \\(y^{s},y^{o}\\) and \\(y^{n}\\) given \\(q\\) and \\(c^{s}\\). We propose _answer probability_ as a proxy for measuring whether the model relies more on contextual or parametric knowledge, computed by \\[\\pi_{\\theta}([\\text{OPTION}]|f_{\\text{multi-choice}}(q,c^{s},y^{s},y^{o},y^{n} )), \\tag{3}\\] where [OPTION] is the token of option code, _i.e._, [A], [B] or [C] in out setting. We denote the probabilities of \\(y^{s}\\), \\(y^{o}\\) and \\(y^{n}\\) corresponding to the options as \\(p^{s}\\), \\(p^{\\phi}\\), \\(p^{\\theta}\\), respectively. We visualize the tendency of three pre-trained LLMs with two types of prompting strategies on the test set of Natural Questions (Fisch et al., 2019) in Figure 1. With both the instruction-based and opinion-based prompts, Llama-2-7b and Llama-2-7b-chat give almost the same probabilities for the substituted and original answer. Vicuna-7b-v1.5 shows maximum sum of the three probabilities, indicating strongest understanding of the multi-choice task. Even so, Vicuna-7b-v1.5 struggles to decisively choose the substituted answer and still has an likelihood around 0.25 to select the original answer. Hence we draw the conclusion that _the hypothesis of LLMs having capabilities of responding according to both the contextual and parametric knowledge holds true_."

      "text": "Typically, an MDP \\(\\mathcal{M}\\triangleq\\langle\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},r,\\mathbb{P},\\rho_{0},\\gamma\\rangle\\) consists of the state space \\(\\mathcal{S}\\), the action space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), a reward function \\(r\\), the transition probability \\(\\mathbb{P}\\), the initial state distribution \\(\\rho_{0}\\) and a discount factor \\(\\gamma\\). The generation process of an LLM is naturally an MDP where each state \\(s\\in\\mathcal{S}\\) is the context comprising prompt tokens \\(\\tilde{a}_{0:m}\\) and previously generated tokens \\(a_{0:t-1}\\). The initial state \\(\\tilde{s}\\) is the sequence of prompt tokens \\(\\tilde{a}_{0:m}\\) sampled from the distribution \\(\\rho_{0}\\).1 Action space \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) is a finite vocabulary \\(\\mathcal{V}=\\{1,\\dots,|\\mathcal{V}|\\}\\). Given the current state \\(s_{t}=a_{0:t-1}\\), the LLM selects an action \\(a_{t}\\) from \\(\\mathcal{A}\\), identically samples a token from the vocabulary \\(\\mathcal{V}\\) with the distribution \\(\\pi_{\\theta}\\) in an auto-regressive manner formulated as \\(a_{t}\\sim\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}|s_{t})=\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}|a_{0:t-1})\\). The transition in LLM is deterministic as the next state \\(s_{t+1}\\) is definitely transformed into \\(a_{0:t}\\) after the action \\(a_{t}\\) is selected. Afterward, a deterministic reward \\(r_{t}\\) is given by the reward function: \\(r_{t}=r(s_{t},a_{t})\\). A state is regarded as terminated when a special end-of-text token is selected or the response reaches the max length. We define the state action value function \\(Q^{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s,a)\\triangleq\\mathbb{E}_{\\mathbb{P},\\pi_{\\theta}}\\left[\\sum_ {t=0}^{T-1}\\gamma^{t}r^{t}|s_{0}=s,a_{0}=a\\right]\\), which represents the expected return following policy \\(\\pi_{\\theta}\\) after taking action \\(a\\) at the state \\(s\\). The state value function is defined as \\(V^{\\pi_{\\theta}}=\\mathbb{E}_{a\\sim\\pi_{\\theta}}\\left[Q^{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s,a)\\right]\\), _i.e.,_ the expected Figure 1: Average answer probabilities of the substituted answer \\(p^{s}\\), original answer \\(p^{o}\\) and none response \\(p^{n}\\) for Llama-2-7b, Llama-2-7b-chat (Touvron et al., 2023) and Vicuna-7b-v1.5 (Zheng et al., 2023) with instruction-based and opinion-based prompting strategies. Generating tokens other than option codes is also feasible so that the sum of three probabilities is less than 1. Details of prompts are listed in Appendix E. return following \\(\\pi_{\\theta}\\) from state \\(s\\). The primary objective of optimizing the LLM via reinforcement learning is to maximize the expectation of discounted cumulative reward: \\[J(\\pi_{\\theta})=\\mathbb{E}_{\\delta\\sim\\rho_{0}}\\mathbb{E}_{a_{0:T-1}\\sim\\pi_{ \\theta}}\\left[\\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\\gamma^{t}r_{t}\\right]. \\tag{4}\\]"

      "title": "Objective Of Trustworthy-Alignment",
      "text": "We aim at aligning the language model to the trustworthy status where it supplies responses in accordance with merely the retrieved evidence and ignores the parametric knowledge. To achieve this goal, we propose a simple yet effective reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm which rewards the model's reliance on contextual knowledge and penalizes its reliance on parametric knowledge. Specifically, given the question \\(q\\) and substituted context \\(c^{s}\\), we reward \\(\\pi_{\\theta}\\) as long as the counterfactual answer \\(y^{s}\\) appears in the terminated response and penalize it if the original answer \\(y^{o}\\) appears or neither answers are included, formulated as \\[r_{t}^{\\text{trust}}=\\begin{cases}+\\alpha_{0}&\\text{if }s_{t+1}\\text{ ends }\\wedge y^{s}\\subseteq s_{t+1}\\wedge y^{o}\\nsubseteq s_{t+1}\\\\ -\\alpha_{1}&\\text{if }s_{t+1}\\text{ ends }\\wedge y^{s}\\nsubseteq s_{t+1}\\wedge y^{o} \\nsubseteq s_{t+1}\\\\ -\\alpha_{0}&\\text{if }s_{t+1}\\text{ ends }\\wedge y^{o}\\subseteq s_{t+1}\\\\ 0&\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}, \\tag{5}\\] where \\(\\alpha_{0}\\) and \\(\\alpha_{1}\\) control absolute values of reward and penalty. Note that only the last generated token is rewarded so that this reward is on the sentence level. Indispensably, a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence term is added to the reward following preceding works (Jaques et al., 2019; Stiennon et al., 2020) to penalize the policy's deviation from the original supervised fine-tuned model \\(\\pi^{\\text{SFT}}\\), formulated as \\[r_{t}^{\\text{KL}}=-\\alpha_{2}\\log\\left[\\frac{\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}|s_{t})}{\\pi^{ \\text{SFT}}(a_{t}|s_{t})}\\right], \\tag{6}\\] where \\(\\alpha_{2}\\) is a coefficient controlling the training trade-off between a model performing specific task and a model more like the original one. Even with the regularization of KL divergence, LLMs are prone to falling into local optima in the training procedure of RL. For instance, pre-trained LLM may continually output the same repeated pattern when a short repetitive string like \"\\(\\backslash\\)n\\(\\backslash\\)n\\(\\backslash\\)n\" shows up in the prompt, which will be reinforced and overwhelm the cumulative \\(r_{t}^{\\text{trust}}\\) in the subsequent training procedure by virtue of its low accumulative KL penalty. To avoid this, we propose an additional collapse penalty to persuade the LLM from collapsed mode: \\[r_{t}^{\\text{col}}=g(s_{t+1})=\\begin{cases}-\\alpha_{3}&\\text{if }s_{t+1}\\text{ ends and collapses}\\\\ 0&\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}, \\tag{7}\\] where \\(\\alpha_{3}\\) controls the absolute value of \\(r_{t}^{\\text{col}}\\) and the collapse detection algorithm is described in Appendix C. Overall, the final reward function is formulated as \\[r(s_{t},a_{t})=r_{t}^{\\text{trust}}+r_{t}^{\\text{col}}+r_{t}^{\\text{KL}}. \\tag{8}\\] We train the policy with PPO algorithm (Schulman et al., 2017). We propose an annealing strategy to trade-off between exploration and exploitation in PPO training of LLMs, which is detailed in Appendix B due to space constraints. The algorithm pipeline of Trustworthy-Alignment is described in Appendix C."

    {
      "title": "Theoretical Analysis",
      "text": "In this subsection, we theoretically analyze the proposed Trustworthy-Alignment, ensuring the policy's convergence to the trustworthy status. Specifically, we demonstate that the optimal policy for the total reward \\(r(s_{t},a_{t})\\) is consistent with the optimal policy for the task-specific reward \\(r_{t}^{\\text{trust}}\\), while \\(r_{t}^{\\text{KL}}\\) and \\(r_{t}^{\\text{col}}\\) do not affect the realization of the alignment. Actually, the purpose of designing these regular terms is to accelerate the model's learning procedure in practice (Ng et al., 1999). Formally, we define an original MDP as \\(\\mathcal{M}\\triangleq\\langle\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},r,\\mathbb{P},\\rho_{0},\\gamma\\rangle\\), where \\(\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},\\mathbb{P},\\rho_{0},\\gamma\\) share the same definitions as in Section 3.1. Both \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) and \\(\\mathcal{A}\\) are finite sets, and \\(r\\) is defined as \\(r(s_{t},a_{t},s_{t+1})=r_{t}^{\\text{trust}}\\).2 A transformed MDP is defined based on the original MDP \\(\\mathcal{M}\\) as \\(\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}\\triangleq\\langle\\mathcal{S},\\mathcal{A},r^{\\prime}, \\mathbb{P},\\rho_{0},\\gamma\\rangle\\), which differs from \\(M\\) in that the reward function is defined as \\(r^{\\prime}(s_{t},a_{t},s_{t+1})=r_{t}^{\\text{trust}}+r_{t}^{\\text{col}}+r_{t}^{ \\text{KL}}\\). The reward functions of both MDPs are bounded. We will show that the optimal \\({\\pi^{*}}^{\\prime}\\) obtained on \\(\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}\\) can be equivalent to the optimal \\(\\pi^{*}\\) obtained on \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). Our analysis approach is similar to the Potential-based Reward Shaping theory (Ng et al., 1999). Firstly, we introduce the definition of the state potential function and provide a lemma. Footnote 2: Note that \\(r(s_{t},a_{t},s_{t+1})=r(s_{t},a_{t})\\), since \\(s_{t+1}\\) can be uniquely determined by \\(s_{t}\\) and \\(a_{t}\\) in the context of language models. **Definition 3.1**.: For any \\(s\\in\\mathcal{S}\\), define its potential function as follows: \\[\\Psi(s)=g(s)-\\alpha_{2}\\log P_{\\pi_{\\theta}}(s)+\\alpha_{2}\\log P_{\\pi^{\\text{ SFT}}}(s), \\tag{9}\\] where \\(P_{\\pi}(s)=\\prod\\pi_{\\theta}(a_{t}|a_{0:t-1})\\) indicates the probability of state \\(s\\) generated from \\(\\pi\\). It can be known that \\(\\Psi(s_{t+1})-\\Psi(s_{t})=r_{t}^{\\prime}-r_{t}=r_{t}^{\\text{col}}+r_{t}^{ \\text{KL}}\\), while the reward function \\(r_{t}^{\\text{trust}}\\) cannot be decomposed into a subtraction of some potential function, as discussed in detail in Appendix A. Using the potential function, we can prove the following lemma about order-preserving properties. **Lemma 3.2**.: _(Order Preserving) There exists a potential function \\(\\Psi(\\cdot)\\) such that \\(\\Psi(s_{t+1})-\\Psi(s_{t})=r_{t}^{\\prime}-r_{t}\\)\\(r_{t}\\). Given state \\(s\\in\\mathcal{S}\\) and policy \\(\\tilde{\\pi}\\), for any actions \\(a_{1},a_{2}\\in\\mathcal{A}\\), when \\(\\gamma=1\\), if \\(Q^{\\sharp}_{\\mathcal{M}}(s,a_{1})>Q^{\\tilde{\\pi}}_{\\mathcal{M}}(s,a_{2})\\), then \\(Q^{\\tilde{\\pi}}_{\\mathcal{M}}(s,a_{1})>Q^{\\tilde{\\pi}}_{\\mathcal{M}}(s,a_{2})\\). Otherwise, assume \\(Q^{\\tilde{\\pi}}_{\\mathcal{M}}\\) is continuous function with respect to \\(\\gamma\\), when \\(\\gamma\\) is sufficiently close to \\(1\\), if \\(Q^{\\tilde{\\pi}}_{\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}}(s,a_{1})>Q^{\\tilde{\\pi}}_{\\mathcal{M}^ {\\prime}}(s,a_{2})\\), then \\(Q^{\\tilde{\\pi}}_{\\mathcal{M}}(s,a_{1})>Q^{\\tilde{\\pi}}_{\\mathcal{M}}(s,a_{2})\\)._ The proof can be found in Appendix A. This lemma indicates that when \\(\\gamma\\) is large enough, for the same policy, the relative numerical relationship of the Q-function of the transformed MDP \\(\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}\\) is consistent with the original MDP \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). Therefore, we can obtain the following consistency and convergence theorem. **Theorem 3.3**.: _(Consistency and Convergence) Assume \\(Q^{\\tilde{\\pi}}_{\\mathcal{M}}\\) is a continuous function with respect to \\(\\gamma\\), when \\(\\gamma\\) is sufficiently close to \\(1\\), the optimal policy obtained in MDP \\(\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}\\) is also the optimal policy in MDP \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). The policy \\(\\pi^{\\prime}\\) obtained from the training of the RL algorithm has the following error bounds with the optimal policy, where \\(\\pi^{*}\\) is the optimal policy on \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), \\(\\epsilon=\\left\\|\\mathcal{T}Q^{\\pi^{\\prime}}_{\\mathcal{M}}-Q^{\\pi^{\\prime}}_{ \\mathcal{M}}\\right\\|_{\\infty}\\), \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is the Bellman Optimal Operator:_ \\[\\left\\|V^{\\pi^{\\prime}}_{\\mathcal{M}}-V^{\\pi^{*}}_{\\mathcal{M}}\\right\\|_{ \\infty}\\leq\\frac{2\\gamma\\epsilon}{1-\\gamma}. \\tag{10}\\] The proof is detailed in Appendix A. According to the theorem, we guarantee that LLMs trained with Trustworthy-Alignment converge to the trustworthy status."

Samples in ConflictQA is transformed into multiple-choice QA format following Xie et al. (2023) and thus we directly assess the _accuracy_ (Acc) for this dataset. Additionally, we adopt memorization ratio (Longpre et al., 2021)\\(M_{R}=\\frac{p_{o}}{p_{o}+p_{o}}\\) to measure the LLM's capability of forgetting parametric knowledge, where \\(p_{o}\\) and \\(p_{s}\\) are the fractions of samples that model predicts the original answer and substituted answer, respectively. Note that \\(p_{s}\\) is equivalent to average EM and Acc and an LLM is deemed as in trustworthy status if owning a small memorization ratio. Following Longpre et al. (2021), we narrow the evaluation on Natural Questions by only preserving samples that LLM can correctly respond the original answer in a closed-book setting, meaning that the knowledge is originally stored in its parameters. Nevertheless, we do not perform this filter on ConflictQA as multi-choice QA task is profoundly affected by the order of options (Wang et al., 2018; Ko et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2023b; Zheng et al., 2023), which renders the filtering unreliable."

      "text": "The proposed alignment algorithm significantly improves the trustworthiness of retrieval-augmented LLMs.We present the performance of Trustworthy-Alignment and compared baselines on Natural Questions in Table 1. From the results, we observe that with training-free prompt engineering approach, GPT-4 serves as the most effective model with respect to EM. The hand-crafted opinion-based prompt shows better EM and lower \\(M_{R}\\) than instruction-based prompt on almost all of these model. The opinion-based prompt formulates the contextual information as somebody's opinion and thus LLM believes what is provided and ignores what is true in its parametric knowledge. However, GPT-4 memorizes more often than other models. We analyze the output of GPT-4, finding that it always presents not only facts in the opinion but also knowledge stored in its parameters, and thus shows highest memorization ratio. Examples are shown in Appendix F. With Trustworthy-Alignment and supervised fine-tuning, all of three open-source models achieves significantly higher EM and lower \\(M_{R}\\). Notably, even without explicit supervision on how to respond, Trustworthy-Alignment achieves comparable performance to supervised fine-tuning and even surpasses it when using the stronger model Llama-2-7b-chat. Performance of Trustworthy-Alignment on Llama-2-7b and Vicuna-7b-v1.5 is inferior to supervised fine-tuning due to weaker instruction-following capability of base models, which will be discussed in the following subsection. \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{c l c c c c c c} \\hline \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{Model} & \\multirow{2}{*}{Method} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Natural Questions} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{ConflictQA-PopQA} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{ConflictQA-StrategyQA} \\\\ \\cline{3-8} & & EM (\\%) \\(\\uparrow\\) & \\(M_{R}\\) (\\%) \\(\\downarrow\\) & Acc (\\%) \\(\\uparrow\\) & \\(M_{R}\\) (\\%) \\(\\downarrow\\) & Acc (\\%) \\(\\uparrow\\) & \\(M_{R}\\) (\\%) \\(\\downarrow\\) \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{ChatGPT} & Instruction & 47.73 & 45.23 & 85.61 & 9.09 & 84.29 & 21.06 \\\\ & Opinion & 76.34 & 16.41 & 88.41 & 6.92 & 85.25 & 20.33 \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{2}{*}{GPT-4} & Instruction & 77.41 & 76.17 & 75.35 & 19.40 & 72.86 & 34.63 \\\\ & Opinion & 89.71 & 84.14 & 86.19 & 11.43 & 83.63 & 20.65 \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{Llama-2-7b} & Instruction & 10.16 & 83.41 & 71.43 & 27.10 & 59.96 & 41.11 \\\\ & Opinion & 20.32 & 66.97 & 68.67 & 26.82 & 43.22 & 50.98 \\\\ & SFT & **92.34** & **1.58** & 76.19 & **13.30** & 67.38 & 39.76 \\\\ & Ours & 82.93 & 1.65 & **81.19** & 18.20 & **69.17** & **37.32** \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{Vicuna-7b-v1.5} & Instruction & 48.80 & 39.57 & 79.15 & 10.25 & 66.96 & 29.44 \\\\ & Opinion & 50.80 & 31.31 & 79.16 & **8.56** & 69.76 & 25.90 \\\\ \\cline{1-1} & SFT & **93.14** & **1.09** & **90.74** & 9.54 & 71.73 & 29.97 \\\\ \\cline{1-1} & Ours & 91.22 & 2.00 & 66.14 & 12.24 & **77.06** & **24.19** \\\\ \\hline \\multirow{3}{*}{Llama-2-7b-chat} & Instruction & 46.00 & 40.00 & 74.06 & 16.76 & 73.53 & 35.19 \\\\ \\cline{1-1} & Opinion & 62.17 & 24.54 & 74.31 & **10.59** & **75.07** & **31.73** \\\\ \\cline{1-1} & SFT & 92.42 & 1.24 & **85.31** & 15.40 & 73.70 & 38.35 \\\\ \\cline{1-1} & Ours & **94.92** & **0.70** & 66.14 & 12.24 & 64.87 & 31.79 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} Table 1: Performance comparison between Trustworthy-Alignment (Ours), supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and two prompting methods (Instruction and Opinion). Open-source models are trained on Natural Questions and evaluated on all three datasets. \\(\\uparrow\\) indicates that higher is better, while \\(\\downarrow\\) means lower is better. Results of best method for each model are highlighted in bold. **Inherent capacity and adequate exploration are indispensable in aligning LLMs to trustworthy status.** To delve more profoundly into the training process of Trustworthy-Alignment, we visualize curves of training episodic reward, as well as \\(p^{s}\\), \\(p^{o}\\) and \\(M_{R}\\) on held-out evaluation dataset. As shown in Figure 2, Llama-2-7b-chat and Vicuna-7b-v1.5 enjoy stable training where the training episodic reward and \\(p^{s}\\) climb up while \\(p^{o}\\) and \\(M_{R}\\) decline gradually. Llama-2-7b behaves differently from the other two models. In the early training phase, Llama-2-7b is the weakest model and holds the lowest training episodic reward. Continued poor performance persists due to a lack of exploration in high-reward areas. As the LLM gradually reaches the area where substituted answers appear, _i.e._, near 2000 episodes in Figure 2, the performance displays a steep climb to a status with high training episodic reward and low evaluation \\(M_{R}\\). This phenomenon emphasizes the demand of inherent trustworthy status in pre-trained LLMs and exploration in the training process for Trustworthy-Alignment. Generally, the performance of all three models converges as the training carrying on, demonstrating the stability of the Trustworthy-Alignment algorithm with inherent trustworthy status in pre-trained LLMs. **The trustworthy aligned model generalizes well to out-of-domain datasets.** We evaluate the LLMs aligned with Natural Questions data on two additional datasets ConflictQA-PopQA and ConflictQA-StrategyQA, whose questions and contexts have never been seen and even the task is transformed from free-form QA to multi-choice QA. As shown in Table 1, Trustworthy-Alignment improves the accuracy of Llama-2-7b and Vicuna-7b-v1.5 on ConflictQA-PopQA and ConflictQA-StrategyQA over prompt engineering approaches. Meanwhile, Trustworthy-Alignment surpasses SFT with respect to the metric \\(M_{R}\\) by a large margin for the Llama-2-7b and Vicuna-7b-v1.5 model on ConflictQA-StrategyQA, indicating its more significant suppressing effect on parametric memory. This verifies the favorable generalization capability of Trustworthy-Alignment to out-of-domain datasets. **Aligning LLMs via RL preserves language styles of original pre-trained models.** A by-product of aligning LLMs via RL is that language styles of original pre-trained models are preserved, while SFT changes them totally. We showcase responses of LLMs aligned via Trustworthy-Alignment and SFT in Appendix F.

Figure 2: Curves of training episodic reward, \\(p^{s}\\), \\(p^{o}\\) and \\(M_{R}\\) on held-out evaluation dataset in the training procedure of Trustworthy-Alignment on Natural Questions. The solid curves represent the mean value and the shaded areas correspond to the standard deviations of 3 runs with different seeds. The curve of episodic reward is smoothed by averaging within a sliding window. For a clear presentation of task performance, the KL penalty is not included in the curve of episodic reward but visualized alone in Appendix D.1. sentences. By contrast, Llama-2-13b-chat aligned with SFT provides barely answers, even without periods. This is a reasonable phenomenon as the demonstration data used in RL is actually collected from the LLM in the training process, which keeps the same language style with the pre-trained model. The data used in SFT is labeled by human whose style distribution may be distinct from the original model. This phenomenon is also an evidence that the trustworthy status is an inherent ability of LLMs rather than assigned by external supervision data. Additionally, we provide human evaluation results on language style and fluency of Trustworthy-Alignment in Section 4.3 to further demonstrates that aligning via RL indeed helps. Aligning LLMs to trustworthy status via RL enjoys preferential alignment tax treatment.Ouyang et al. (2022) declare that training LLM with PPO suffers from \"alignment tax\", _i.e._, model's performance drops on several public NLP datasets after aligning the model. We evaluate trustworthy aligned LLMs on the Open LLM Leaderboard task set. As the results in Table 2 show, the performance of aligned Vicuna-7b-v1.5 on these six datasets drops less than 1% while the supervised fine-tuning reduces the performance more. Unexpectedly, Trustworthy-Alignment enhances the Llama-2-7b-chat's performance on some of these out-of-domain datasets, like ARC, MMLU and TruthfulQA. A possible explanation is that, Trustworthy-Alignment encourages Llama-2-7b-chat to concentrate more on the information in prompt, which is helpful for these improved datasets. We also find that whether it is Trustworthy-Alignment or supervised fine-tuning, both decline noticeably on GSM8k, though Trustworthy-Alignment surpasses supervised fine-tuning with all of three base models. This may be due to the limited error tolerance of mathematical reasoning task and thus more future works are needed to further mitigate the alignment tax."

      "text": "Despite that we do not intend to align LLMs with human preference via the proposed algorithm, human evaluation is an indispensable evaluation protocol for language generation. Thus, we conduct human evaluations for alignment tax and fluency of Trustworthy-Alignment. Specifically, we randomly select question-context pairs from the test set of Natural Questions, generate responses using pre-trained, supervised-finetuned and trustworthy aligned Llama-2-7b-chat models for each pair. Human evaluators are asked to judge whether the response from supervised-finetuned or trustworthy aligned model is closer to the pre-trained model in terms of language style. Naturally, more similar language style with pre-trained model indicates lower alignment tax. Besides, we ask human evaluators to select their most preferred response out of these three models for measurement of fluency. We collect feedback on 40 question-context pairs from 33 human evaluators, and compute the mean values and standard deviations of win rate for each model. According to the results shown in Figure 3, the responses of Trustworthy-Alignment are significantly more analogous to the pre-trained model and more fluent than SFT model. These results are expected since the RL algorithm in Trustworthy-Alignment reinforces some of the intrinsic outputs of pre-trained LLM, while SFT forces the pre-trained LLM to follow the style of provided demonstration data."

Annealing**). * We investigate the scaling law of Trustworthy-Alignment by training with different actor model size, including a 1.3B model chat-opt-1.3b7 **(1.3B)** and a 13B model Llama-2-13b-chat **(13B)** * We replace critic model in Trustworthy-Alignment with a random initialized chat-opt-350m-reward (**Random Critic**) and a pre-trained Llama-2-7b-chat without head layer (**Larger Critic**) Footnote 7: [https://huggingface.co/AdamG012/chat-opt-1.3b-sft-deepspeed](https://huggingface.co/AdamG012/chat-opt-1.3b-sft-deepspeed). As shown in Table 3, \"wo. Annealing\" obtains higher EM and \\(M_{R}\\) than baseline, which indicates a much higher \\(p^{o}\\). These results are consistent with the expectation that exploration plays a crucial role in the whole aligning procedure discussed in Section 4.2. Without large temperature in the early stage of annealing exploration, LLMs generate less experience excluding the parametric knowledge, and thus is less penalized for memorizing. Likewise, 1.3B model exhibits a much inferior performance resulting from lack of exploration on output including the contextual knowledge. The larger 13B model does not show markedly better performance than the original 7B model. We speculate that 7B model is enough for approaching the upper limit of our tasks so that the verification of scaling law for larger models may requires stronger benchmarks. Results of \"Random Critic\" and \"Larger Critic\" indicate that neither the pre-training nor scaling up critic models in alignment via reinforcement learning exerts substantial influence on the performance, which is consistent with one of the conclusions in Li et al. (2023)."

      "title": "Hallucination",
      "text": "Hallucination in LLMs is defined as generating content that is nonsensical or contradict to the source input and typically divided into extrinsic and intrinsic hallucinations (Ji et al., 2023). An LLM may present responses that cannot be verified from the source or generated content (Maynez et al., 2020), which is referred to as extrinsic hallucination. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Lewis et al., 2020) attempts to tackle this type of hallucination by storing knowledge in an extra knowledge base, retrieve and relying on related knowledge during generation. Despite that verifiability is significantly enhanced, the conflict between parametric and contextual knowledge (Longpre et al., 2021) triggers the intrinsic hallucination where LLMs generate outputs inconsistent with retrieved information (Mallen et al., 2023). Longpre et al. (2021) and Neeman et al. (2023) construct counterfactual data and utilize supervised fine-tuning to compel LLMs to focus on the retrieved context. Chen et al. (2022) expand the study of knowledge conflicts to multiple evidence setting and proposes a recalibration method encouraging LLMs to abstain from answering questions in conflict. Prompt engineering is also proved to be effective for improving faithfulness in knowledge conflict situations (Zhou et al., 2023; Si et al., 2023). These dedicated efforts imply inherent capabilities of responding according to parametric and contextual knowledge in LLMs. Based on this, we take the first step towards encouraging LLMs to explore trustworthy status with reinforcement learning where only what to achieve is provided."

      "text": "Alignment was first introduced to create agents that behave in line with the intention of users (Leike et al., 2018) and boomed in the era of LLMs due to the strong demand for AI assistants harmony with human values (Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022). Alignment is achieved by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Christiano et al., 2017) that trains a reward model representing human preference and optimize an instruction-tuned model (Wei et al., 2022) using the reward model. Beyond that, researchers extend the RLHF to reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) (Bai et al., 2022) and self-alignment (Sun et al., 2023) that learn with feedback generated from language models to reduce the dependence of human annotations. Moreover, safe RL framework (Garcia and Fernandez, 2015) is integrated into alignment to mitigate the conflict between helpfulness and harmless of LLMs. A grand vision of aligning future superhuman models with weak models (Burns et al., 2023) confirms the long-term value of alignment technology in the development of AGI. Different from existing works that mainly focus on aligning agents with human intention and values, we expand the application scenarios of alignment to creating trustworthy agents."

Note that \\(r_{t}^{\\text{trust}}\\) cannot be expressed as the difference between the potential functions of two neighboring states, since \\(r_{t}^{\\text{trust}}\\) depends not only on the state \\(s_{t+1}\\), but also on \\(y^{s}\\) and \\(y^{o}\\). \\(y^{s}\\) and \\(y^{o}\\) can, however, be viewed as feedback following an MDP input action (i.e., an MDP input action \\(a_{t}\\) outputs \\(S_{t+1},y^{s},y^{o},r_{t}^{\\text{trust}}\\)). However, this feedback is not given directly, but rather in an indirect form as a reward \\(r_{t}^{\\text{trust}}\\). Since \\(r_{t}^{\\text{trust}}\\) cannot be expressed as a difference of potential functions, based on to Potential-based Reward Shaping theory (Ng et al., 1999), it is known that that there exists a preferred optimal policy for the original MDP \\(M\\) (the preference policy guided by rewards in MDP \\(M\\) is the policy that produces trustworthy responses) and that there is no case where any policy without any preference is optimal. **Lemma A.2**.: _(Order Preserving) There exists a potential function \\(\\Psi(\\cdot)\\) such that \\(\\Psi(s_{t+1})-\\Psi(s_{t})=r_{t}^{\\prime}-r_{t}\\).

When \\(Q_{\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}}^{\\tilde{\\pi}}(s,a_{1})>Q_{\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}}^{ \\tilde{\\pi}}(s,a_{2})\\), taking the limit on both sides of equation 19 has: \\[\\lim_{\\gamma\\to 1^{-}}Q_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\tilde{\\pi}}(s,a_{1})-Q_{\\mathcal{M}}^{ \\tilde{\\pi}}(s,a_{2})=Q_{\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}}^{\\tilde{\\pi}}(s,a_{1})-Q_{ \\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}}^{\\tilde{\\pi}}(s,a_{2})>0. \\tag{20}\\] By the order-preserving nature of the limit it follows that there exists \\(\\delta>0\\) such that when \\(\\gamma>1-\\delta\\), there is \\(Q_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\tilde{\\pi}}(s,a_{1})>Q_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\tilde{\\pi}}(s,a_{2})\\) **Theorem A.3**.: _(Consistency and Covergence) Assume \\(Q_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\tilde{\\pi}}\\) is continuous function with respect to \\(\\gamma\\), when \\(\\gamma\\) is sufficiently close to \\(1\\), the optimal policy obtained in MDP \\(\\mathcal{M}^{\\prime}\\) is also the optimal policy in MDP \\(\\mathcal{M}\\). The policy \\(\\pi^{\\prime}\\) obtained from the training of the RL algorithm has the following error bounds with the optimal policy, where \\(\\pi^{\\star}\\) is the optimal policy on \\(\\mathcal{M}\\), \\(\\epsilon=\\left\\|\\mathcal{T}Q_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\pi^{\\prime}}-Q_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\pi^ {\\prime}}\\right\\|_{\\infty}\\), \\(\\mathcal{T}\\) is the Bellman Optimal Operator:_ \\[\\left\\|V_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\pi^{\\prime}}-V_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\pi^{\\star}}\\right\\|_{ \\infty}\\leq\\frac{2\\gamma\\epsilon}{1-\\gamma}. \\tag{21}\\] Proof.: The same initialization policy is used to optimize the policy in each of the two MDPs using the Policy Improvement Theorem (Sutton & Barto, 2018), and the optimal policies are obtained after continuous policy iterations. The action with the largest Q-function value will be selected in each state in the first iteration, and according to the Order Preserving Lemma, it is known that the action with the largest value is the same in both MDPs (if more than one action have the largest value, we assume that the same action will be selected in both MDPs). So after the first iteration, the same policy will still be obtained in both MDPs. By mathematical induction, we can see that after the same number of iterations, we will still get the same policy. Therefore, after iterating the same number of times to converge to the optimal policy, there will be the same optimal policy in MDP \\(M\\) and MDP \\(M^{\\prime}\\). By Theorem 4.1 in Williams et al. (1993), it follows that \\(\\left\\|V_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\pi^{\\prime}}-V_{\\mathcal{M}}^{\\pi^{\\star}}\\right\\|_{ \\infty}\\leq\\frac{2\\gamma\\epsilon}{1-\\gamma}\\)."

      "title": "Appendix B Annealing Exploration",
      "text": "The trade-off between exploration and exploitation is a crucial challenge in RL (Sutton & Barto, 2018) lying also in Trustworthy-Alignment. Exploration is necessary to try out new responses that may hit the correct answer of a given question. Exploitation ensures that the policy select the best option based on currently explored experiences to maximize the long-term benefits. Trustworthy-Alignment trains the LLM in an on-policy manner where experience sampling is conducted using the latest version of its updating parametric policy. The amount of randomness in the response depends on the generation configuration of the current policy, especially the temperature \\(\\tau\\). Large \\(\\tau\\) enhances randomness by spreading the action probability distribution while small \\(\\tau\\) brings more certainty by sticking the most possible action out. Thus, analogous to the decreasing exploration rate in the \\(\\epsilon\\)-greedy policy (Mnih et al., 2015), we propose an _annealing exploration_ strategy where the temperature for experience generation starts from a large value and gradually decreases, to control the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Specifically, the temperature in training step \\(i\\) is defined as \\[\\tau(i)=(1-\\frac{i}{N})\\tau^{\\text{initial}}+\\frac{i}{N}\\tau^{\\text{final}}, \\tag{22}\\] where \\(\\tau^{\\text{initial}}>\\tau^{\\text{final}}\\), and \\(\\tau\\) anneals linearly from \\(\\tau^{\\text{initial}}\\) to \\(\\tau^{\\text{final}}\\) over \\(N\\) total training steps."

      "title": "Alignment To The Parametric Knowledge",
      "text": "An assumption for Trustworthy-Alignment is that the retriever is good enough to return contexts containing right answers for given questions. However, this assumption does not always hold true. To provide a potential solution for trade-off between parametric and contextual knowledge, we conduct experiment on probing parametric knowledge of LLMs via Trustworthy-Alignment. Specifically, we modify the reward in Equation (5) to \\[r_{t}^{\\text{trust}}=\\begin{cases}+\\alpha_{0}&\\text{if }s_{t+1}\\text{ ends }\\wedge(y^{s}\\subseteq s_{t+1}\\lor y^{o}\\subseteq s_{t+1})\\\\ -\\alpha_{1}&\\text{if }s_{t+1}\\text{ ends }\\wedge y^{s}\\nsubseteq t_{t+1}\\wedge y^{o} \\nsubseteq t_{t+1}\\\\ 0&\\text{otherwise}\\end{cases}, \\tag{23}\\] with which the model is also rewarded when the original answer appears in the response. We conduct experiment with Llama-2-7b-chat and report the proportion of samples whose responses contain the substituted, original and both answers and memorization ration in Table 5. It can be observed that \\(p^{o}\\), \\(p^{both}\\) and \\(M_{R}\\) significantly improves with a simple modification on the reward coefficients, indicating Trustworthy-Alignment's encouraging effect on recalling much more parametric knowledge. We reckon this ability a potential solution for the imperfect retriever and will take a deep dive into this research question in our future work. In addition, it is worth noting that \\(p^{s}\\) decreases slightly after the modified alignment. We check the exploration process in the training of LLM and find few responses in the collected experiences including both the contextual and parametric answers. A possible explanation is that pre-trained Llama-2-7b-chat is too weak to generate experience that includes both answers and to be reinforced. And thus reaching a response mode produce responses containing both the original and substituted answers is hard for small models.

The solid curves represent the mean value and the shaded areas correspond to the standard deviations of 3 runs with different seeds.

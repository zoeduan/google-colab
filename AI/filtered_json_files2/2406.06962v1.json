  "abstract": "\n Large language models have ushered in a new era of artificial intelligence research. However, their substantial training costs hinder further development and widespread adoption. In this paper, inspired by the redundancy in the parameters of large language models, we propose a novel training paradigm: Evolving Subnetwork Training (EST). EST samples subnetworks from the layers of the large language model and from commonly used modules within each layer, Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). By gradually increasing the size of the subnetworks during the training process, EST can save the cost of training. We apply EST to train GPT2 model and TinyLlama model, resulting in 26.7% FLOPs saving for GPT2 and 25.0% for TinyLlama without an increase in loss on the pre-training dataset. Moreover, EST leads to performance improvements in downstream tasks, indicating that it benefits generalization. Additionally, we provide intuitive theoretical studies based on training dynamics and Dropout theory to ensure the feasibility of EST. Our code is available at  https://github.com/OpenDFM/EST . \n",

      "text": "Large language models have ushered in a new era of artificial intelligence research. However, their substantial training costs hinder further development and widespread adoption. In this paper, inspired by the redundancy in the parameters of large language models, we propose a novel training paradigm: Evolving Subnetwork Training (EST). EST samples subnetworks from the layers of the large language model and from commonly used modules within each layer, Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). By gradually increasing the size of the subnetworks during the training process, EST can save the cost of training. We apply EST to train GPT2 model and TinyLlama model, resulting in 26.7% FLOPs saving for GPT2 and 25.0% for TinyLlama without an increase in loss on the pre-training dataset. Moreover, EST leads to performance improvements in downstream tasks, indicating that it benefits generalization. Additionally, we provide intuitive theoretical studies based on training dynamics and Dropout theory to ensure the feasibility of EST.

      "text": "Large language models (LLMs) have become significantly larger recently, bringing tremendous potential in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The computational cost of training such large language models has become a bottleneck, hindering further development in research and applications. Additionally, the escalating hardware demands and increasing carbon footprints associated with training large language models are also crucial issues (Schwartz et al., 2020). This highlights the importance of researching efficient algorithms for training large language models. The enormous training cost of large language models stems from their massive number of parameters. For instance, the GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020) model has 175 billion parameters, requiring 355 GPU-years and incurring a training cost of $4.6M. However, numerous studies have highlighted the redundancy in the parameters of large language models, manifested in the over-parameterization (Li et al., 2020) and conditional sparsity (Li et al., 2023) of these models. This inspires us to optimize the training process by exploring the possibility of not training the complete model at certain stages but focusing on training subnetworks, thereby reducing the overall training cost of large language models. In this paper, we propose a novel training paradigm, **Evolving Subnetwork Training (EST)**, towards efficient training for large language models. EST paradigm consists of two main components: 1) sample from the large language model for subnetwork training. We maintain the complete model and sample subnetworks in each training step from the model across three dimensions, including the number of attention heads, the intermediate size of multi-layer perceptron, and the total number of Transformer layers. 2) We design a sampling scheduler to plan the training process. By increasing the size of subnetworks during training and, finally, training the complete model, EST achieves training acceleration. To demonstrate the effectiveness of EST, we first conduct experiments on GPT2 model (Radford et al., 2019), and conduct scale-up experiments on 1.1B TinyLlama (Zhang et al., 2024) model. The results show that: 1) EST saves 26.7% training cost for GPT2 model and 25.0% training cost for TinyLlama model, with a comparable loss on the pre-training dataset. 2) Models trained by EST achieve even higher downstream performance, indicating that EST benefits model generalization. Furthermore, we dive into theoretical studies to answer the following two questions: 1) why EST can save training cost without compromising model performance? 2) Why EST can benefit model generalization? We provide a comprehensive theoretical framework based on deep learning dynamics and Dropout theory to ensure the superiority and feasibilityof EST. In general, the contributions of this work include the following aspects: * We propose a novel model training paradigm, EST, achieving higher optimization efficiency of training large language models. * We conduct experiments on GPT2 and TinyLlama. The results show that EST saves training cost without sacrificing model performance and benefits generalization. * We provide intuitive theoretical studies to ensure the feasibility of EST."

There are numerous approaches to overcome the computation bottleneck of Transformer-based models. FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) identifies that the attention module is bottleneck by memory access, and optimizes the process of attention computation, effectively reducing the training cost. Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) approximates attention computation based on locality-sensitive hashing and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021) simplifies attention computation with low-rank approximation. Sparse training methods also benefit optimization efficiency. The main component of sparse training methods is the Mixture of Experts (MoE). MoE methods (Fedus et al., 2022; Du et al., 2022) apply conditional computation according to different inputs in order to scale up models without significantly increasing training costs. The drawback of the MoE model is that its performance cannot match that of the dense model with an equivalent number of parameters. Another category of sparse training methods is based on the lottery ticket hypothesis (Frankle and Carbin, 2019; Chen et al., 2021), that certain subnetworks exhibit comparable performance to that of the original complete network. However, the sparsity generated by such methods is typically unstructured, making it challenging to translate into acceleration on general GPU devices. Monarch (Dao et al., 2022) and Pixelated Butterfly (Dao et al., 2021) lower the training overhead of models without compromising their performance by introducing structured sparsity in matrix operations, which are more low-level and can be combined with our approach for complementary benefits. Ma et al. (2024) leverages sparsity in pre-trained LLMs to expedite the training process. In this paper, we mainly focus on the design of a top-level training strategy, which is orthogonal to these approaches. Different from MoE methods that choose subnetworks based on input tokens, our method samples subnetworks randomly."

      "text": "The most similar prior works are those called incremental training methods (Shen et al., 2022). This kind of work typically starts from smaller models and gradually scales up to larger ones. Incremental training methods are effective in both the NLP and CV domains since they reduce the time needed for model training and enhance training stability. Net2net (Chen et al., 2016) first reveals the feasibility of using the parameters of smaller models as initialization for larger model parameters and provides some operations for scaling up model sizes. Shen et al. (2022) involves multi-stage training of the GPT2 model across both depth and width dimensions. bert2BERT (Chen et al., 2022) applies the principles of Net2net to pre-trained language models. MSG (Yao et al., 2023) employs a masking mechanism that sets newly expanded parameters to zero when scaling up small models. Unlike these methods that individually train smaller models, disregarding interactions between parameters, our approach EST maintains the complete model and samples subnetworks from it to train."

Let \\(\\Phi\\) denote the parameters of the model, \\(\\phi\\subset\\Phi\\) denote the parameters of the subnetwork, and \\(L\\) denote the loss function. Let \\(f_{\\phi}\\) denote the function of the subnetwork, which takes sequence \\(\\mathbf{X}\\) as input and outputs the prediction of next tokens. The object of subnetwork training is formulated as \\[\\min_{\\phi}L(f_{\\phi}(\\mathbf{X}),\\mathbf{y}), \\tag{4}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{y}\\) is the ground truth label. In our approach, we sample subnetworks randomly from the complete model in each training step. To obtain subnetworks, we sample across three dimensions related to the size of the Transformer model: the number of attention heads \\(N_{H}\\), the intermediate size of MLP module \\(N_{M}\\), and the total number of Transformer layers \\(N_{L}\\). **Sampling Attention Heads \\(N_{H}\\):** For each MHA module, during the subnetwork training, we randomly sample a subset of heads \\(\\mathbb{I}_{H}\\) for computation at each training step, where \\(\\mathbb{I}_{H}\\subset\\{1,2,...,N_{H}\\}\\), \\(|\\mathbb{I}_{H}|=N_{H}p_{H}\\) and \\(p_{H}\\) is the sampling rate.

      "title": "Evolving Subnetwork Training",
      "text": "In this section, we propose our novel training paradigm for large language models, **E**volving **S**ubnetwork **T**raining (EST), which applies subnetwork training method in Section 3.2, and progressively increases the size of subnetworks. Finally, train the complete model. **Definition 3.1**.: Let \\(T\\) denote the total stages of training. A sampling scheduler consists of two parts: 1) \\(S=(s^{1},...,s^{T})\\) that contains the time points of stage transitions, indicating when to increase the size of subnetworks; 2) \\(P=[(p_{H}^{1},p_{M}^{1},p_{L}^{1}),...,(p_{H}^{T},p_{M}^{T},p_{L}^{T})]\\) that contains sampling rates in each stage, indicating how to increase the size of subnetworks. EST employs the sampling scheduler to plan the training process. By incrementally increasing the size of subnetworks as the training stages progress and eventually training the complete model, EST achieves training acceleration. The pseudo-code of EST is as Algorithm 1. **Practical Sampling Scheduler:** In this paper, we won't dive into complex sampling schedulers. For convenience, we use a kind of three-stage sampling scheduler in practice. Specifically, our sampling scheduler consists of the following three stages: * **Stage 1**: In this stage, we sample from all three dimensions to achieve the highest acceleration ratio. That is, \\(0<p_{H}<1\\), \\(0<p_{M}<1\\), \\(0<p_{L}<1\\). * **Stage 2**: In this stage, we stop sampling from the Transformer layers, ensuring that the number of activated layers in the subnetwork is consistent with the complete model, while continuing sampling from the MHA and MLP modules. That is, \\(0<p_{H}<1\\), \\(0<p_{M}<1\\), \\(p_{L}=1\\). Additionally, in this stage, we keep \\(p_{H}\\) and \\(p_{M}\\) consistent with the first stage. * **Stage 3**: In the final stage, train the complete model, where \\(p_{H}=1\\), \\(p_{M}=1\\), \\(p_{L}=1\\). The process of EST with this kind of sampling scheduler is illustrated in Figure 1. **Training Cost Saving:** Assuming that, under the condition of equal training steps, the model trained by EST achieves the same performance as the original model, EST can indeed achieve a reduction in training cost. This is because the cost of training subnetworks is smaller than that of training the complete model. For ease of analysis, we calculate how much training cost is saved by EST with the practical sampling scheduler. Let \\(C_{H},C_{M}\\) denote the cost of each MHA module and MLP Figure 1: Overview of our EST method with practical sampling scheduler. The router takes \\(\\mathbb{I}_{L}\\) as input and determines whether to activate the current layer. In stage 1, we obtain a subnetwork to train by sampling from \\(N_{H},N_{M}\\) and \\(N_{A}\\) dimensions. In such subnetworks, only some layers are activated and in each activated layer, and only some attention heads and MLP neurons are used. In stage 2, all layers are activated while in each layer still only a subset of the layer is used. In stage 3, the complete model is activated. module, neglecting other modules like Layer Normalization (Ba et al., 2016) as their cost is relatively small compared to MHA and MLP. So the training cost of a single training step in each stage is formulated as \\[C_{1} =N_{L}p_{L}(p_{H}C_{H}+p_{M}C_{M}), \\tag{8}\\] \\[C_{2} =N_{L}(p_{H}C_{H}+p_{M}C_{M}),\\] \\[C_{3} =N_{L}(C_{H}+C_{M}).\\] Based on the training steps for each stage, the total training cost can be calculated. Let \\(r_{1},r_{2},r_{3}\\) denote training steps of each stage, respectively. The total training cost is formulated as \\[C_{EST} =r_{1}C_{1}+r_{2}C_{2}+r_{3}C_{3} \\tag{9}\\] \\[=(r_{1}N_{L}p_{L}p_{H}+r_{2}N_{L}p_{H}+r_{3}N_{L})C_{H}\\] \\[+(r_{1}N_{L}p_{L}p_{M}+r_{2}N_{L}p_{M}+r_{3}N_{L})C_{M}.\\] On the other hand, the training cost of training the complete model is \\[C_{original}=(r_{1}+r_{2}+r_{3})N_{L}(C_{H}+C_{M}). \\tag{10}\\] For a more intuitive illustration, Table 1 shows the training cost under specific configurations that \\(p_{H}=p_{M}=p_{L}=0.5\\), \\(r_{1}=r_{2}=r_{3}=r\\) compared with cost of training the original model through naive training method. Under such configurations, EST can save \\(41.7\\%\\) of training cost."

The batch size is set to 512 and the sequence length is 1024. The total training step is 150k. For the downstream performance, we experiment on three tasks: GLUE (Wang et al., 2018), SQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), and LAMBADA (Paperno et al., 2016).

The stage transition occurs at step 50k, and this baseline saves \\(16.7\\%\\) of the training FLOPs. For another baseline MSG (Yao et al., 2023), due to the inability of this method to simultaneously expand attention heads and intermediate sizes, the training stage settings in the MSG baseline differ slightly from our EST method: * **Stage1 (0-20k)**: Utilizing a model with half the number of layers, attention heads, and intermediate size. * **Stage2 (20k-40k)**: Restoring the number of layers and using a model with half the attention heads and intermediate size. \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{l c c} \\hline \\hline Stages & EST & Original \\\\ \\hline Stage 1 & \\(0.25rN_{L}(C_{H}+C_{M})\\) & \\(rN_{L}(C_{H}+C_{M})\\) \\\\ Stage 2 & \\(0.5rN_{L}(C_{H}+C_{M})\\) & \\(rN_{L}(C_{H}+C_{M})\\) \\\\ Stage 3 & \\(rN_{L}(C_{H}+C_{M})\\) & \\(rN_{L}(C_{H}+C_{M})\\) \\\\ \\hline Total & \\(1.75rN_{L}(C_{H}+C_{M})\\) & \\(3rN_{L}(C_{H}+C_{M})\\) \\\\ Saving & \\(1.25rN_{L}(C_{H}+C_{M})\\) & 0 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} Table 1: An intuitive example of training cost saving. The real world wall time saving is shown in Appendix A.3* **Stage3 (40k-70k)**: Restoring the attention heads and using a model with half the intermediate size. * **Stage4 (70k-150k)**: Training the complete model. **Main Results:** We compare EST with the naive training method that trains the complete model, Staged Training method and MSG method. The results are as the Table 2. Our approach EST saves \\(26.7\\%\\) of training FLOPs and leads to 1.22x speed up of the wall clock training time without increasing the loss on the validation dataset. The loss curve of GPT2 trained by EST can be found in Appendix A.1. Additionally, we find that the model trained by EST has better downstream performance, indicating that EST also enhances the generalization of GPT2 model. However, despite saving 16.7% of the training FLOPs, the performance of the model obtained by Staged Training cannot match the original model. Compared to MSG method, our EST approach achieves higher acceleration effects and delivering superior model performance. **Effect of Sampling Scheduler:** We also conduct experiments to evaluate the effect of different sampling schedulers. Besides our practical sampling scheduler, we evaluate model performance on five different sampling schedulers: * EST-ONE-STAGE: \\(S=(150k)\\), \\(P=[(0.5,0.5,1)]\\). * EST-TWO-STAGE-A: \\(S=(50k,150k)\\), \\(P=[(0.5,0.5,1),(1,1,1)]\\). * EST-TWO-STAGE-B: \\(S=(70k,150k)\\), \\(P=[(0.5,0.5,1),(1,1,1)]\\). * EST-TWO-STAGE-C: \\(S=(90k,150k)\\), \\(P=[(0.5,0.5,1),(1,1,1)]\\). * EST-THREE-STAGE: \\(S=(20k,70k,150k)\\), \\(P=[(0.5,0.5,0.5),(1,1,0.5),(1,1,1)]\\). Among these five sampling schedulers, EST-ONE-STAGE is exactly the stage 2 of the practical sampling scheduler and does not train the complete model at all. EST-TWO-STAGE-A, EST-TWO-STAGE-B, and EST-TWO-STAGE-C skip the stage 1 of the practical sampling scheduler and have different stage transition points. EST-THREE-STAGE, on the other hand, modifies the stage 2 of the practical sampling scheduler by disabling the sampling from MHA and MLP and enabling the sampling from the number of layers. The results are shown in Table 3. We find that our three-stage practical sampling scheduler saves more training cost than two-stage sampling schedulers with comparable model performance. On the other hand, results of EST-ONE-STAGE and EST-TWO-STAGE-C indicate that a long enough stage 3 is vital. In addition, the experiment on EST-THREE-STAGE sampling scheduler indicates that, in stage 2, sampling from MHA modules and MLP modules performs better than sampling from layers."

      "title": "Why Can Est Save Training Cost Without Compromising Model Performance",
      "text": "In general, EST enhances the dynamics of model training, resulting in a steeper loss curve and faster loss descent compared to the naive training approach, so it can save training cost without compromising model performance. To provide a more specific explanation, we first need to introduce two important properties in previous incremental training methods (Shen et al., 2022): _loss-preserving property_ and _training-dynamics-preserving property_. Subsequently, we point out that it is precisely because EST breaks away from these two properties that it can achieve savings in model training cost in a broad range of scenarios. **Loss-preserving Property:** The loss-preserving property implies that during a transition in the training stages, the models before and after the transition should represent the same function, resulting in identical loss. **Training-dynamics-preserving Property:** Intuitively, the training-dynamics-preserving property means that in the final stage of incremental training, the loss curve should match that of the target model. **Why Should Break Away from These Properties:** In incremental training methods, maintaining these two properties is to ensure the feasibility of extending the parameters of a smaller model as the initialization parameters for the target model. However, to maintain these two properties while achieving the goal of saving training cost, incremental training methods require expanding the parameters to the size of the target model early in the training process (Shen et al., 2022). Therefore, when the model training requires a sufficient number of training steps, incremental training methods can actually save very little in training cost. EST breaks away from these two properties, alleviating this issue. **Break Away from Loss-preserving Property:** EST method dose not maintain the loss-preserving property. During stage transitions when increasing the size of the subnetworks, the loss experiences a sudden drop compared to the previous stage. Due to the equivalence between the random sampling of subnetworks and Structural Dropout (Pal et al., 2020), we can theoretically demonstrate using Dropout theory. Intuitively, training subnetworks via random sampling implicitly introduces a regularization term to the loss function, and the increase in subnetwork size reduces this regularization term, resulting in a sudden drop in loss. **Break Away From Training-dynamics-preserving Property:** EST method does not maintain the training-dynamics-preserving property. In the final stage of training, the model trained with EST exhibits better training dynamics compared to the target model obtained through naive training method. Intuitively, EST method is equivalent to the use of Structural Dropout in earlier stages.

Even in the final stage when training the complete model, the model parameters can still maintain flatness, reducing the difficulty of parameter optimization and accelerating the descent of the loss. **Towards Training Cost Saving:** How does the disruption of these two properties affect the efficiency of model training? We compare the loss curves of TinyLlama trained by EST and the original training method in Figure 2. Firstly, we observe that during stage transitions, the loss drops sharply, which is the result of breaking the loss-preserving property, providing a better starting point for each stage. On the other hand, we notice that in stage 3, the slope of the EST loss curve is greater than the slope of the original loss curve under the same loss condition. This is a direct result of breaking the training-dynamics-preserving property, which is the key to the success of EST. If the training-dynamics-preserving property holds, the loss curve in stage 3 will be parallel to the loss curve of the original training method, and thus, the two curves will not intersect, eliminating the possibility of saving training costs. It is precisely because the EST method improves the dynamics of model training that it leads to savings in training costs without sacrificing model performance."

      "title": "Why Can Est Benefit Model Generalization",
      "text": "In Section 4, we observe that the EST method not only achieves comparable loss on the pre-training dataset compared to the naive training method, but also brings some improvement in downstream tasks. This indicates an enhancement in the model's generalization performance. Liu et al. (2023a) investigate the phenomenon where different models exhibit significant differences in downstream tasks under the same loss on the pre-training dataset. Furthermore, they find a strong correlation between the model's generalization ability and the trace of the Hessian matrix of the loss function with respect to the model parameters. The process of sampling subnetworks in the EST method is equivalent to Structural Dropout, which can effectively reduce the trace of the Hessian matrix in the early stages. However, more importantly, we find that even in the final stage of training the complete model, the Hessian matrix still maintains a relatively small trace until the end of training. This contributes to the better generalization performance of the final model obtained through EST. In Table 5, we demonstrate that GPT2 models trained through EST exhibit a smaller trace of the Hessian matrix and stronger generalization performance compared to models obtained through naive training method. Here \\(\\mathrm{Tr}[\\nabla^{2}L(\\phi)]\\) denotes the trace of Hessian matrix of the loss function with respect to the model parameters."

      "title": "6 Conclusion",
      "text": "Our goal is to achieve more efficient training for large language models. We propose a novel training method, Evolving Subnetwork Training (EST), which operates subnetwork training via random sampling and uses sampling scheduler to plan the process of training incrementally. Our approach enhances the efficiency of model training on GPT2 and TinyLlama models, saving 26.7% and 25.0% of training FLOPs respectively, with comparable pre-training performance. In addition, EST benefits the generalization ability of both GPT2 and TinyLlama, evaluated by several \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \\hline \\hline \\multicolumn{2}{c}{Wall Clock Time(hours)} & Speed Up & Saving FLOPs & Loss & GPT4All \\\\ \\hline Original & 192.8 & 1x & 0 & **2.64** & 42.40 \\\\ \\hline EST & **158.2** & **1.22x** & **25\\%** & 2.65 & **42.79** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} Table 4: Main results of experiment with TinyLlama model.

With almost the same pre-training loss, EST method has higher GLUE score for smaller trace of Hessian matrix. Figure 2: Loss curves of EST compared with the original training method. downstream tasks. We also provide intuitive theory studies, demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of EST. Through theoretical analysis, we find that the efficient training dynamics of EST comes from the flatness of parameters. This insight may inspire other efficient training methods. In future works, we aim to provide the theoretical support for the design of sampling schedulers, to apply EST for training on even larger models. Additionally, since EST essentially samples for matrix multiplication, it can be applied not only to Transformer models but also to models like Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023). We will conduct experiments on other types of models to broaden the application scope of EST."

      "title": "Impact Statement",
      "text": "This work's ethical impact is rooted in the ethical risks associated with large language models themselves. While there are numerous ethical risks linked to large language models, this paper primarily focuses on efficient training for such models, and thus, these ethical risks are not the main emphasis of this paper. Therefore, we believe it is not necessary to highlight them here. The future societal consequences of this work primarily involve its impact on the environment and the applications of large language models. As this work helps reduce the training costs of large language models, it contributes to mitigating the carbon emissions caused by research and applications of such models, thereby aiding environmental conservation. Simultaneously, the cost savings may also facilitate a broader and more widespread application of large language models in society."

      "title": "Details For Wall Time Saving",
      "text": "We test the efficiency of the EST method on GPT2 and TinyLlama models and assess the real acceleration effects. We will analyze the wall time overhead of each module and the time overhead under different training setups. Here we mainly analyze the impact of sampling on the MHA and MLP modules. These two modules involve matrix multiplication, and our sampling alters the size of these matrices. Since matrix multiplication is parallelized on GPUs, it's challenging to intuitively calculate the actual acceleration effect. For both GPT2-base and TinyLlama 1.1B model, we investigate the impact of different batch sizes on training speed when using Distributed Data Parallel (DDP). For simplicity, we discuss the practical sampling scheduler in Table 1. We use A100 80GB GPU to test both GPT2 model and TinyLlama model. For the GPT2 model, the actual acceleration effects are as Table 8. For the TinyLlama 1.1B model, the actual acceleration effects are as Table 9. In these two tables, GPU time refers to the time spent on forward computations for each module or layer on the GPU. Total time indicates the overall time cost for each training step, including both forward and backward computation. The final speedup rate is not \\(4\\times\\) for stage1 and not \\(2\\times\\) for stage 2 due to two reasons: (1) GPUs compute matrix multiplication in parallel, so the time consumption is not directly proportional to the number of rows or columns of the matrix; (2) In addition to GPU computation time, there is also high memory access overhead during model training. As the batch size increases, the bottleneck of training gradually shifts from memory access to computation, resulting in an increase in the speedup, and the speedup on GPU time gradually approaches \\(2\\times\\). \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c} \\hline \\hline & Saving FLOPs & HellaSwag & Obqa & WinoGrande & \\(\\mathrm{ARC_{c}}\\) & \\(\\mathrm{ARC_{e}}\\) & Boolq & Piqa \\\\ \\hline Original & 0 & 33.54 & 29.40 & 50.51 & 23.04 & 38.55 & 59.60 & 62.13 \\\\ \\hline EST & 25.0\\% & 33.40 & 27.20 & 52.88 & 23.29 & 38.93 & 61.16 & 62.68 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} Table 7: Detailed GPT4All scores of TinyLlama model.

      "text": "Among the three sampling methods we use, sampling for the number of Transformer layers is straightforward and will not be elaborated. However, the sampling operation for the dimensions of MHA and MLP modules within each layer is more complex. This will be detailed here. The operation within each Transformer layer can be illustrated as Figure 5. The index generator generates indexes \\(\\mathbb{I}_{H}\\), \\(\\mathbb{I}_{M}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{I}_{L}\\). The router before each module takes \\(\\mathbb{I}_{H}\\) or \\(\\mathbb{I}_{M}\\) as input and activates the corresponding part of the module."

      "title": "Implementation Of Index Generator",
      "text": "The index generator simply generates random numbers as sampling indices. However, since it operates on the CPU, and once the indices are generated, they need to be transferred to the GPU memory. Executing it as part of the model before each forward pass could result in unnecessary time overhead. To optimize the training process as much as possible, we use an additional thread to run the index generator asynchronously to the model training. Once the index generator generates the next set of indices, it places them in a queue. When the model needs to sample, it retrieves the values from the queue. This completely eliminates the overhead of the index generator. Figure 7: The detailed implementation of sampling for MLP module."

  "abstract": "\n Mental health challenges pose considerable global burdens on individuals and communities. Recent data indicates that more than 20% of adults may encounter at least one mental disorder in their lifetime. On the one hand, the advancements in large language models have facilitated diverse applications, yet a significant research gap persists in understanding and enhancing the potential of large language models within the domain of mental health. On the other hand, across various applications, an outstanding question involves the capacity of large language models to comprehend expressions of human mental health conditions in natural language. This study presents an initial evaluation of large language models in addressing this gap. Due to this, we compare the performance of Llama-2 and ChatGPT with classical Machine as well as Deep learning models. Our results on the DAIC-WOZ dataset show that transformer-based models, like BERT or XLNet, outperform the large language models. \n",

      "text": "To address Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), (Han et al., 2017) proposes a passive diagnostic system that integrates clinical psychology, machine learning, and conversational dialogue systems. Through the use of sequence-to-sequence neural networks, a real-time dialogue system engages individuals, while specialised machine learning classifiers monitor conversations to predict critical depression symptoms. Evaluation results indicate potential advancements in human-like chatbots and depression identification. Despite acknowledging limitations in data representation and a small sample size, the study suggests the possibility of enhancing support for individuals with MDD through real-time communication tools. Similarly, (Han et al., 2017) introduces a deep neural network for predicting PHQ-4 scores (depression and anxiety levels) from written text. Leveraging the Universal Sentence Encoder and a deep learning Transformer neural network, the model demonstrates efficacy in psychometric score prediction. Exploring application to social media data, the study incorporates psycholinguistic features and a multi-dimensional deep neural network, noting challenges related to domain-specificity and generalizability. In addressing MDD, (Kang et al., 2018) employs natural language processing to create a neural classifier detecting depression from speech transcripts. By predicting individual depression symptoms, the study utilises a symptom network analysis approach and achieves comparable results to state-of-the-art models in binary diagnosis and depression severity prediction. Similarly, (Beng et al., 2017) focuses on toxic workplace communication in emails, introducing ToxiScope, a taxonomy to detect and quantify toxic language patterns. Through annotation tasks and machine learning models, the study reveals insights into implicit and explicit workplace toxicity. The research suggests refining detection methods and exploring correlations between toxicity, power dynamics, and biases in workplace communication for future directions. [19] explore the potential of objective digital biomarkers in assessing psychiatric disorders. By investigating behavioral and physiological signals extracted from remote interviews, the research assesses the complementary information provided by multimodal features. The study derives time series features from four conceptual modes: facial expression, vocal expression, linguistic expression, and cardiovascular modulation. These features are extracted from audio and video recordings of remote interviews, using task-specific and foundation models. Four binary classification tasks are defined, including the detection of clinically-diagnosed psychiatric disorders, major depressive disorder, self-rated depression, and self-rated anxiety. Results indicate statistically significant feature differences between controls and subjects with mental ill-health conditions, with correlations found between features and self-rated depression and anxiety scores. The best unimodal performance is achieved by visual heart rate dynamics, with areas under the receiver-operator curve (AUROCs) ranging from 0.68 to 0.75. Combining multiple modalities enhances performance, yielding AUROCs of 0.72 to 0.82. Task-specific models outperform foundation models, suggesting the effectiveness of specific features. This comprehensive multimodal analysis on 73 subjects, using remotely-recorded telehealth interviews, reveals informative characteristics of clinically diagnosed and self-rated mental health status. The study provides early evidence of the utility of multimodal digital biomarkers extracted from low-cost, non-lab-controlled data, offering insights into the most suitable modalities and methods for automated remote mental health assessments. Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3, GPT-4, and Google's PaLM, show potential to revolutionise psychotherapy by supporting, augmenting, or possibly replacing human-led interventions, addressing challenges in mental healthcare capacity and providing personalised treatments. [28] offer a roadmap for the responsible application of clinical LLMs in psychotherapy. It provides a technical overview, discusses integration stages with parallels to autonomous vehicle technology, explores potential applications in clinical care, training, and research, and offers recommendations for responsible development and evaluation. While recognizing the promise of LLMs, the paper urges caution, emphasizing the need for psychologists to approach integration with care, educate the public about risks, and actively engage with technologists. It advocates for ongoing monitoring and advocacy for responsible and ethical use of LLMs in psychotherapy to ensure patient well-being. [8] delves into primary challenges in LLM development for psychological counseling, addressing model hallucination, interpretability, bias, privacy, and clinical effectiveness. Practical solutions are suggested based on the authors' experiences. While medical applications of LLMs have been experimented with, superior performance over human doctors is noted alongside evidence of limitations in mental health counseling. AI acceptance in medicine, especially mental ill-health, requires substantial improvements and responsible development. The paper anticipates LLM integration into the medical field, acknowledging increased regulatory scrutiny. Challenges are detailed from academic research, advocating a holistic approach and emphasizing diverse data representation and cautious model fine-tuning. Regulatory bodies are expected to play pivotal roles, demanding evidence of beneficial model use. Despite potential shifts in the AI landscape, leveraging the current paradigm is deemed imperative amid escalating global mental health disorders. The paper underscores the necessity of enhancing existing LLMs for psychological counseling tools, recognizing exceptional benefits despite formidable challenges. [25] highlight the increasing attention on generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), and their potential in analyzing extensive medical records for insights into neurology. The paper explores various use cases for LLMs in neurology, including early diagnosis, patient and caregiver support, and assisting clinicians. It acknowledges potential ethical and technical challenges, such as privacy concerns, data security, biases in training data, and the importance of rigorous validation. While recognizing these challenges, the paper emphasises the promising opportunities LLMs present for enhancing the care and treatment of neurologic disorders, underscoring the need for responsible research practices. [35] addresses the growing significance of social media as a valuable source for automatic mental health analysis, focusing on interpretable models. While recent large language models (LLMs) have been explored for this purpose, their unsatisfactory performance in zero-shot/few-shot scenarios poses challenges. To tackle this, the authors introduce the first multi-task and multi-source interpretable mental health instruction (IMHI) dataset, containing 105K data samples from diverse social media sources. They use ChatGPT to generate explanations and rigorously evaluate correctness, consistency, and quality. The resulting MentalLaMA, an open-source instruction-following LLM series, achieves state-of-the-art performance, generating ChatGPT-level explanations and displaying strong generalizability to unseen tasks on the IMHI benchmark. The paper contributes a comprehensive dataset and model for interpretable mental health analysis on social media. [34] present a comprehensive evaluation of various Language Models (LLMs), including Alpaca, Alpaca, FLAN-T5, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4, in the context of mental ill-health prediction tasks using online text data. The experiments cover zero-shot prompting, few-shot prompting, and instruction finetuning, revealing key insights. The context enhancement strategy consistently improves performance for all LLMs, and mental health enhancement proves effective for models with a substantial number of trainable parameters. Few-shot prompting consistently boosts model performance, even with just one example per class. Crucially, instruction finetuning across multiple datasets significantly enhances model performance across various mental health prediction tasks. The top finetuned models, Mental-Alpaca and Mental-FLAN-T5, outperform larger models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, performing on par with the state-of-the-art task-specific model Mental-RoBERTa. An exploratory case study on reasoning capabilities underscores both promising potential and notable limitations of LLMs. The findings are distilled into guidelines for researchers, developers, and practitioners enhancing LLMs' understanding of mental health for downstream tasks. Emphasis is placed on the ethical considerations in this research domain, highlighting that practical deployment of LLMs in mental health applications is currently distant. [4] focus on fine-tuning an LLM for a specific function in psychology using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and explores its viability. The theoretical foundation of LLMs, RLHF, and the ethical considerations of developing a psychological AI are presented. Previous studies on RLHF and AI in psychology demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed goal. The methodology for training and evaluating the model involves comparing a pre-trained model with the fine-tuned one, whereby the study finds no clear difference between the used models. The study also delves into an ethical framework for a digital psychology assistant, proposing a suitable introduction to the market and the division of responsibilities. The discussion extends to rules and regulations applicable to this research field, emphasizing the need for governments to introduce relevant regulations for AI innovation, encompassing ethics, accountability, and personal data protection. [15] investigate the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically Med-PaLM 2, trained on extensive medical knowledge, to predict psychiatric functioning from patient interviews and clinical descriptions without specific training for such tasks. Analyzing 145 depression, 115 PTSD assessments, and 46 clinical case studies across various disorders, the results indicate that Med-PaLM 2 can assess psychiatric functioning effectively. The strongest performance is observed in predicting depression scores (Accuracy range= 0.80 - 0.84), which is statistically indistinguishable from human clinical raters. The findings suggest the potential of general clinical language models to flexibly predict psychiatric risk based on free descriptions from both patients and clinicians. [20] address the growing interest in utilizing LLMs in mental health research and identifies a lack of a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating their capabilities in this domain. The authors introduce PsyEval, the first benchmark tailored to the unique characteristics of mental ill-health, consisting of six sub-tasks across three dimensions. Eightadvanced LLMs are evaluated using PsyEval, revealing significant room for improvement in current LLMs in mental health-related tasks. Notably, GPT-4 shows satisfactory performance in mental health Question-Answering (QA) but still requires advancement. The benchmark highlights performance gaps, particularly in tasks involving disease prediction from social media posts and accurate forecasting of depression and suicide severity in simulated doctor-patient dialogues. The results emphasise the need for further advancements in tailoring language models for mental health applications, and PsyEval is positioned as a valuable tool for assessing and guiding such developments."

GAD 1 and GAD 2 relate to anxiety and PHQ-1 and PHQ-2 relate to depression. One participant may have many messages, but that participant has only one overall PHQ4 score. Their score is divided into the four separate categories; GAD-1, GAD-2, PHQ-1 and PHQ-2. As some of the messages were quite short in the dataset, we decided to lengthen the messages to add more contextual information to a PHQ4 score that might be associated with that particular person. We concatenated messages to a maximum of 50 words per observation. We only concatenated messages together that were from the same person. We did not concatenate messages together that were from two different people. After the concatenation step and duplicates and missing values removed, there were 28,186 observations in the training set and 8,710 in the test set."

      "title": "Prompting Llms",
      "text": "In order to retrieve a specific response from the LLMs, we prompted the targeted LLMs with five different queries and evaluated each of them on their performance. The variation differed in terms of lexicalised outputs as well as the definitions and length of the prompts provided to the LLM. Some initial exploratory experiments led to the formation of templates to structure the prompts that were used. We tailored each prompting strategy to each one of the PHQ or GAD questions. This meant that there was a total of 20 different prompts. Differences between versions of prompts only varied slightly. Some differences were minor, such as using \"on a scale of zero to three\" in one prompt and \"one a scale of 0 to 3\" in another. Some prompts were brief (cf. Version 3 in 1), while others were lengthy and included examples of messages that had been evaluated based on specific GAD or PHQ questions within the prompt. The goal of the prompts was that the LLM would return a number corresponding to the PHQ or GAD question that the prompt was structured around, whereby we had regular expressions to handle the outputs. These consisted of taking the first digit number out of the string or converting numbers in linguistic format to integers. For example,if the chatbot responded with \"This messages looks like it is showing zero levels of anxiety\", then our system would return \"0\". This was to make it easier to analyse and evaluate. \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{p{42.7pt}|p{284.5pt}} \\hline \\hline Version 1 & \\\\ \\hline GAD-1 & On a scale of **zero** to **three**, estimate

      "title": "4.1.4. Transformer Models",
      "text": "For a comparison to LLMs, we leverage the Transformer models (Tang et al., 2019), which rely on a self-attention mechanism, allowing it to capture contextual dependencies in input sequences efficiently. The model consists of an encoder-decoder structure, with multi-head self-attention layers enabling parallelised processing of input tokens. Positional encoding is used to provide information about the token's position in the sequence. The Transformer's attention mechanism facilitates capturing long-range dependencies, making it highly effective for tasks requiring context understanding. Within this work, we compare the BERT and Roberta Transformer models and their distilled versions, i.e. DistilBert and Dsitil-Roberta. In addition to that we leverage the XLNet models as well. The BERT model (Dosov et al., 2017) is pre-trained on large corpora and can then be fine-tuned for specific natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text classification, named entity recognition, and question answering, among others. BERT embeddings have been widely adopted and have significantly improved the state-of-the-art performance in various NLP applications. DistilBERT (Dosov et al., 2018) is a distilled version of BERT, offering a more compact and faster alternative for tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Despite having fewer parameters, DistilBERT embeddings can be utilised in various NLP applications, providing a balance between computational efficiency and model performance. RoBERTa (Dosov et al., 2017), or Robustly optimised BERT approach, is a variant of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, uses dynamic masking during pre-training, removing the Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) objective, and training with larger mini-batches and learning rates. These modifications result in a more robust and efficient model. XLNet (Rosenberg et al., 2019) is a Transformer-based language model, which combines ideas from autoregressive language modeling (as seen in models like GPT) and autoencoding (as in BERT) to capture bidirectional context and maintain long-term dependencies in sequences. Instead of predicting the next word in a sentence, XLNet is trained to predict a permutation of the words. This approach allows the model to consider bidirectional context while preventing it from seeing the entire context during training, enhancing its ability to capture dependencies. For all models, we leverage the base version of the transformer models."

Since these two mood disorders often co-occur and individuals with these conditions may struggle with fatigue or difficulty concentrating, the PHQ-4 offers a concise and accurate assessment tool. The PHQ-4 consists of four questions, each answered on a four-point Likert-type scale. It serves the purpose of providing a very brief yet precise measurement of the fundamental symptoms associated with depression and anxiety. It combines a two-item measure for depression (PHQ-2), which focuses on core depressive criteria, and a two-item measure for anxiety (GAD-2), both of which have been independently proven to be effective screening tools. The total PHQ\\(-4\\) score complements the scores of these subscales, offering an overall assessment of symptom burden, functional impairment, and disability. While an elevated PHQ\\(-4\\) score is not diagnostic, it serves as an indicator for further evaluation to confirm the presence or absence of a clinical disorder that requires treatment."

      "title": "Evaluation Metrics",
      "text": "Besides analysing the widely used metrics, i.e., **weighted precision**, **recall** and **F1** for our experiments, we extend our metrics with further metrics in the field of statistics and medicine. **Weighted specificity** describes the accuracy of a test that reports the presence or absence of a medical condition. It can be useful for \"ruling in\" disease since the test rarely gives positive results in healthy patients. A test with a specificity of 1.0 will recognise all patients without the disease by testing negative, therefore a positive test result would rule in the presence of the disease. Nevertheless, a negative result from a test with high specificity is not necessarily useful for \"ruling out\" a disease. As an example, a test that always returns a negative test result will have a specificity of 1.0 because specificity does not consider false negatives. A test like that would return negative for patients with the disease, making it useless for \"ruling out\" the disease. Furthermore, we leverage the Hamming loss and the AUC-ROC Curve. The **Hamming loss** is a metric used in multi-label classification to quantify the accuracy of predictions by measuring the fraction of incorrectly predicted labels across all instances. It is calculated as the average fraction of incorrectly predicted labels per instance, with a score of 0 indicating perfect predictions and 1 indicating complete misclassification. The Hamming loss accounts for both false positives and false negatives in the predicted label sets, making it a valuable measure for evaluating the overall performance of multi-label classification models. The **AUC-ROC** (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) is a graphical representation of a binary classification model's performance across various threshold settings. It plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate, illustrating the trade-off between sensitivity and specificity. The AUC-ROC value quantifies the model's ability to distinguish between classes, with a higher AUC indicating better overall performance."

For GAD-1, prompting Version 3, i.e., _On a scale of **zero to three**, _rate the anxiety of this message_, showed the best performance in terms of weighted F1, as well in weighted precision, recall, Hamming loss and AUC-ROC. For the specificity metric, version 1 slightly outperforms all other prompting options. For GAD-2, the best F1 score is obtained by various prompting versions, with the highest F1 score of 0.53. The best specificity for GAD-2 is achieved by version 3 while prompting with version 1 provides the best AUC-ROC result. In terms of PHQ-1, the best weighted F1 score is obtained using prompting version 1, while the best precision is obtained using version 3 prompting. Similar to the GAD questions, leveraging prompting version 3 for the PHQ-2 question provided the best results in terms of F1, as well as precision and specificity."

As seen in Table 5, XGBoost always outperforms all used models in terms of the Hamming loss metric. Comparing Llama-2 with ChatGPT, we observe minor advantages using ChatGPT, which outperforms Llama-2 on the GAD-2, PHQ-1 and PHQ-2 questions. Finally, we compare the Distil-RoBERTa transformer model with Llama-2 and ChatGPT. Our study shows that the later outperforms all targeted models for all GAD and PHQ questions in terms of weighted precision, recall and F1 score."

      "title": "6. Conclusions",
      "text": "In conclusion, mental ill-health challenges globally impact a significant portion of the population, highlighting the pressing need for effective interventions. Despite the advancements of large language models in various NLP tasks and their diverse applications, a substantial research gap persists regarding their understanding and optimisation within the realm of mental health. This study addresses this gap by conducting an initial evaluation of large language models, comparing the performance of Llama-2 and ChatGPT with the classical machine and deep learning models. Leveraging Llama-2 and ChatGPT, we explore different prompting strategies and evaluate their effectiveness on GAD and PHQ questions. The results indicate that transformer-based models, such as BERT or XLNet, outperform large language models with a significantly larger parameter set. Notably, Distil-RoBERTa consistently outperforms all models for all GAD and PHQ questions in terms of weighted precision, recall, and F1 score. These findings contribute valuable insights for the future development and application of language models in addressing mental health concerns. Nevertheless the outcomes of our initial study, we will further study large language models and how to adapt them to the challenges in mental ill-health. Due to the sensitive nature of mental health information, we will further analyse biases in training data and the dynamic nature of mental health that are the biggest hurdles in achieving comprehensive and unbiased model performance. \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c|c c c c c c} \\hline \\hline & \\multicolumn{8}{c}{GAD-1} & \\multicolumn{8}{c}{GAD-2} \\\\ \\hline & Prec & Rec & F1 & Spec & HammL & AUC-ROC & Prec & Rec & F1 & Spec & HammL & AUC-ROC \\\\ XGBoost & 0.45 & 0.55 & 0.48 & 0.64 & **0.45** & 0.56 & 0.63 & 0.69 & 0.60 & 0.34 & **0.31** & 0.51 \\\\ Llama-2 (v3) & 0.38 & 0.33 & 0.33 & 0.68 & 0.67 & 0.52 & 0.56 & 0.23 & 0.27 & **0.78** & 0.77 & 0.50 \\\\ ChatGPT 3.5 & 0.36 & 0.29 & 0.31 & **0.71** & 0.71 & 0.51 & 0.54 & 0.37 & 0.44 & 0.62 & 0.63 & **0.53** \\\\ Distil-RoBERTa & **0.57** & **0.58** & **0.56** & 0.42 & 0.63 & **0.70** & **0.69** & **0.70** & **0.68** & 0.30 & 0.62 & 0.52 \\\\ \\hline \\multicolumn{10}{c}{PHQ-1} & \\multicolumn{8}{c}{PHQ-2} \\\\ \\hline & Prec & Rec & F1 & Spec & HammL & AUC-ROC & Prec & Rec & F1 & Spec & HammL & AUC-ROC \\\\ XGBoost & 0.51 & 0.54 & 0.48 & 0.61 & **0.46** & 0.55 & 0.52 & 0.53 & 0.48 & 0.66 & **0.47** & 0.56 \\\\ Llama-2 (v3) & 0.43 & 0.29 & 0.30 & **0.76** & 0.71 & 0.53 & 0.34 & 0.34 & 0.32 & 0.65 & 0.66 & 0.49 \\\\ ChatGPT 3.5 & 0.38 & 0.39 & 0.39 & 0.64 & 0.61 & 0.52 & 0.37 & 0.31 & 0.33 & **0.71** & 0.69 & 0.50 \\\\ Distil-RoBERTa & **0.55** & **0.55** & **0.53** & 0.45 & 0.61 & **0.71** & **0.55** & **0.57** & **0.54** & 0.43 & 0.62 & **0.73** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} Table 5.

      "text": "Paraphrase generation is an NLP task that has multiple uses in content creation, question answering, translation, and data augmentation. It is a task that has been attempted for many decades using statistical and rules-based approaches (McKeown, 1979; Meteer and Shaked, 1988). We propose a system that generates paraphrased examples in an autoregressive fashion using a neural network, without the need for techniques such as top-k word selection or beam search. We demonstrate that by using large language models we are able to produce not only paraphrases that are longer and of a higher quality than previous work, but can also paraphrase text beyond the individual sentence-level (i.e. full paragraphs at a time). The large language models we use implement the encoder-decoder structure of the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017) which has been shown to learn different representations of language at each level of its encoding (Devlin et al., 2019). The power of language models like GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019) and BERT allows them to develop useful representations of language which can be used far beyond just generation of the next word (Rothe et al., 2019). In our experiments, we have observed that the models have representations of syntax and grammar, allowing them to be fine-tuned for the task of paraphrase generation."

These have included rule-based approaches (McKeown, 1979; Meteer and Shaked, 1988) and data-driven methods (Madnani and Dorr, 2010), with recently the most common approach being that the task is treated as a language translation task (Bannard and Callison-Burch, 2005; Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Pang et al., 2003) - often performed using a bilingual corpus pivoting back and forth (Madnani and Dorr, 2010; Prakash et al., 2016; Mallinson et al., 2017). Other methods proposed include more recently the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (Li et al., 2018), supervised learning using sequence-to-sequence models (Gupta et al., 2018; Prakash et al., 2016) and unsupervised approaches (Bowman et al., 2016; Roy and Grangier, 2019)."

      "text": "Training language models has become a popular way of creating models suited for Transfer Learning in the field of NLP. (Howard and Ruder, 2018;Peters et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Dong et al., 2019). While these models are initially trained in a semi-supervised manner to predict the next word or words in a sequence, they can be fine-tuned and used for a variety of downstream NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, tagging, and entity extraction. More recently, large language models using transformer architectures are achieving state of the art results for many of these tasks while using less supervised data than previously needed. One example of these large language models that has proven to be very good at text generation is GPT-2. It makes use of a transformer architecture and comes in various sizes up to 1.5 billion parameters. In these experiments, we have taken a pre-trained version of the GPT-2 model trained in a semi-supervised fashion on the WebText dataset (Radford et al., 2019) of over 8 million documents with 40 GB of text in total."

      "title": "Fine-Tuning For Task",
      "text": "We take the GPT-2 model and fine-tune it on a supervised dataset of pre-made paraphrase examples. These examples are fed into the model as original phrase / paraphrase pairs, separated by a specific identifying sequence (such as \">>>>\"). This training is done for a small number of epochs to give the model just enough examples of what the task is asking from the model : The goal being to avoid overfitting the model on the new data, while giving it sufficient exposure to the task to enable it to learn the general pattern expected. While we experimented with TPUs for the fine-tuning, in the end we were able to reproduce the same results on a single K-80 GPU with around 90 minutes of training. Once the model is fine-tuned, we find that it can also produce similar paraphrase training examples if sampled from with no conditional input. To give an indication of training progress, these 'naive' paraphrases are sampled on a periodic basis during the training. After fine-tuning on this dataset, we are then able to feed in any original phrase followed by the unique token and have the model generate paraphrases on demand."

First, we obtain a similarity score between the generated paraphrase and the original sentence by using the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) Cer et al. (2018) to make a 512 dimensional sentence embedding for each output sentence and then compare them to the embedding of the original sentence via the cosine similarity measure. As a second step, we measure the ROUGE-L Lin (2004) score of the candidate paraphrases against the original sentence and eliminate candidates with a ROUGE-L score of above 0.7. This prevents candidates that are too close to the original sentence being chosen. After testing both cutoff scores for ROUGE-L and BLEU Papineni et al. (2002), ROUGE-L has shown to be more useful at finding candidates that are more unique in comparison to the original sentence. By choosing samples with sufficiently low ROUGE-L scores but as high a similarity as possible, we end up with an output that is semantically similar to the original phrase but has a unique word order when compared to the original phrase."

An original dataset of 10,000 sentences from online news articles along with matching paraphrases that were human-generated. 3. A further original dataset of paragraphs with corresponding paraphrased paragraphs from various entertainment, news, and food articles found online, where the paraphrases were human-generated. We fine-tuned 3 versions of the GPT-2 model, one corresponding to each dataset, and then made predictions using the same system outlined above. By calculating USE, ROUGE-L and BLEU scores for each dataset we are able to quantify the quality of human-generated paraphrases and then use that as a comparison for the models generated sentences (see Table 2)."

      "text": "When comparing our generated sentences with the average scores of the original datasets, we can see that that they compare favorably. As discussed earlier, we assessed the semantic similarity of the sentence meanings using Universal Sentence Encoder Cer et al. (2018) and compared them to the average USE score from the datasets that were trained on. This showed that the system can generate paraphrases which are semantically on par with the human-generated ones in each of the datasets. We also compared the ROUGE-L Lin (2004) scores of the generated samples with the average values for the datasets which were human-generated. This again shows that our phrases are coherent and on par with human-generated paraphrases. When we further compared the results of unfiltered examples generated by the model (Table 3) we observe that when the USE score is below 0.85 we see clear deterioration in the semantic similarity quality of the paraphrased versions. We also observe that if the USE score is too close to 1.0 then the ROUGE-L score also rises and the generated examples are too similar in word \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{l|c c c} Dataset & USE & R-L & BLEU \\\\ \\hline MSR\\_train & 0.8462 & 0.4315 & 0.4593 \\\\ MSR\\_test & 0.8415 & 0.4202 & 0.4966 \\\\ News dataset & 0.8948 & 0.4686 & 0.5648 \\\\ Paragraphs dataset & 0.9208 & 0.4966 & 0.5762 \\\\ \\end{tabular} \\end{table} Table 2: Average USE, ROUGE-L, BLEU Scores of the datasetsand phrase selection to the original sentence to be useful paraphrases. This technique can be performed not only at sentence-level but also to generate paragraph-level paraphrases. Comparing USE and ROUGE-L scores of the generated paragraphs we see they are again on par with the human generated examples from our paragraph dataset (samples are given in the Supplemental Materials). Due to the pre-training of the Language Model, the model is able to generalize to and generate paraphrases for types of content it has never seen during the fine-tuning phase."

      "text": "The technique outlined in this paper shows the applicability of large language models to the paraphrasing task. It also highlights that there is still much to be learnt about further applications of large language models, and also the approaches used to fine-tune and use them for applications. Most of the results from models such as GPT-2 have focused on the quality of text generation rather than quantitative methods for measuring and improving the quality of text created, to make it more consistent and usable. We propose the scoring and filtering of candidates using techniques such as we have shown with USE and ROUGE-L, may be a useful technique not just for paraphrasing but other text generation tasks. The ability of our technique to work with long spans of text also gives it an advantage over prior work which used rule-based and other statistical approaches which performed best on shorter spans of text. Our experiments show that pre-training of GPT-2 on such a large amount of data in the WebText dataset allows it to 'understand' the syntax and to a degree the grammar of English allowing it to be able to quickly learn the task of paraphrasing through fine-tuning training on a small set of paraphrasing examples."

One possible approach to doing this would be to trace a set of'markers' through the transformer networks existing attention mechanism, in parallel to the text which gives rise to that structure. In addition, the ability of the networks to learn tasks within the span of a single context frame indicates the possibility of an inherent bias towards meta-( or one-shot) learning. These will be the subject of further work. \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \\hline & \\multicolumn{2}{c|}{USE} & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{R-L} \\\\ \\hline **In:** & A prisoner can asphyxiate himself in 90 seconds and, after eight minutes or & & \\\\ & so, he will be brain dead. & & \\\\ \\hline **Out 1:** & After 8 minutes, a brain far will subdue the sufferer. & 0.524 & 0.0 \\\\ \\hline **Out 2:** & After 8 minutes, he will be brain-dead and his heart will stop. & 0.565 & 0.138 \\\\ \\hline **Out 3:** & A brain aneurysm can asphyxiate itself in 90 seconds and, after eight minutes, it will be dead. & 0.721 & 0.412 \\\\ \\hline **Out 4:** & After eight minutes, a brain anesthetist can asphyxiate a prisoner in 90 seconds and for several minutes after that. & 0.758 & 0.167 \\\\ \\hline **Out 5:** & A brain-dead prisoner canasphyxiate himself in 90 seconds and then out loud after eight minutes. & 0.809 & 0.312 \\\\ \\hline **Out 6:** & At asphyxiation, the prisoner canasphyxiate himself in 90 seconds and, after & 0.884 & 0.514 \\\\ \\hline **Out 7:** & After eight minutes, a prisoner can asphyxiate himself in 90 seconds and, after that, he will be brain dead. & 0.884 & 0.514 \\\\ \\hline **Out 8*:** & **In 90 seconds, a prisoner can asphyxiate himself and be brain dead** & **0.932** & **0.473** \\\\ \\hline **Out 9:** & A prisoner can asphyxiate himself in 90 seconds and, after eight minutes, he will be brain dead. & 0.972 & 0.824 \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} Table 3: Showing Candidates Selection and Scoring - *Selected Sentence"

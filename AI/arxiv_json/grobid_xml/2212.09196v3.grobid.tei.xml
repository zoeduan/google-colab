<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The recent advent of large language models has reinvigorated debate over whether human cognitive capacities might emerge in such generic models given sufficient training data. Of particular interest is the ability of these models to reason about novel problems zero-shot, without any direct training. In human cognition, this capacity is closely tied to an ability to reason by analogy. Here, we performed a direct comparison between human reasoners and a large language model (the text-davinci-003 variant of GPT-3) on a range of analogical tasks, including a non-visual matrix reasoning task based on the rule structure of Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. We found that GPT-3 displayed a surprisingly strong capacity for abstract pattern induction, matching or even surpassing human capabilities in most settings; preliminary tests of GPT-4 indicated even better performance. Our results indicate that large language models such as GPT-3 have acquired an emergent ability to find zero-shot solutions to a broad range of analogy problems.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Analogical reasoning is at the heart of human intelligence and creativity. When confronted with an unfamiliar problem, human reasoners can often identify a reasonable solution through a process of structured comparison to a more familiar situation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">1</ref> This process is an essential part of human reasoning in domains ranging from everyday problem-solving 2 to creative thought and scientific innovation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">3</ref> Indeed, tests of analogical reasoning ability are uniquely effective as measures of fluid intelligence: the capacity to reason about novel problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">5</ref> Recently, there has been considerable debate about whether and how a capacity for analogical thought might be captured in deep learning systems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">6</ref> Much of this recent work has focused on training neural networks on very large datasets (sometimes containing millions of problems). <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">8</ref> Though this is a challenging task that has spurred the development of some interesting approaches, 9-12 it does not address the issue of whether analogical reasoning can emerge zero-shot (i.e., without direct training), the capacity most central to human thought.</p><p>An alternative approach, also based on deep learning, involves large language models (LLMs). <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13</ref> LLMs have recently sparked great interest (and controversy) for their potential to perform few-shot, and even zero-shot, reasoning. These models employ relatively generic neural network architectures with up to billions of parameters, and are trained using a simple predictive objective (predicting the next token in a sequence of text) with massive web-based text corpora consisting of billions of tokens. Though there is significant debate about the capabilities of these models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">14</ref> a potential advantage is their ability to solve problems with little direct training, sometimes requiring only a few examples, or even a simple task instruction (typically without any updating of model parameters). This feature raises the question of whether LLMs might be capable of human-like, zero-shot analogical reasoning.</p><p>To answer this question, we evaluated the language model GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13</ref> on a range of zero-shot analogy tasks, and performed direct comparisons with human behavior. These tasks included a novel text-based matrix reasoning task based on the rule structure of Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM), <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref> a visual analogy problem set commonly viewed as one of the best measures of fluid intelligence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">5</ref> Unlike the original visual SPM problems, our Digit Matrices task was purely text-based so that it could be used to evaluate GPT-3's ability to induce abstract  <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref> Note that the Digit Matrices were purely text-based, and therefore do not test for the ability to perform abstract reasoning directly over visual inputs, as in the original SPM. Letter string results show average performance for novel letter string analogy problem set, based on problems from Hofstadter and Mitchell. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16</ref> Both matrix reasoning and letter string results reflect performance on generative task. Verbal analogy results show average performance on UCLA Verbal Analogy Test. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17</ref> Story analogy problems involved identification of analogous stories based on higher-order relations, using materials from Gentner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">18</ref> Both verbal and story analogy results reflect multiple-choice accuracy, with chance performance indicated by gray horizontal line. Chance performance for the two generative tasks (matrix reasoning and letter string analogies) is close to zero, due to the very large space of possible generative responses. Black error bars represent standard error of the mean for average performance across participants. Each dot represents accuracy for a single participant (matrix reasoning, N=40; letter string analogies, N=57; verbal analogies, N=57; story analogies, N=54). Gray error bars represent 95% binomial confidence intervals for average performance across multiple problems.</p><p>rules (though not the ability to do so directly from visual inputs). Strikingly, we found that GPT-3 performed as well or better than college students in most conditions, despite receiving no direct training on this task. GPT-3 also displayed strong zero-shot performance on letter string analogies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16</ref> four-term verbal analogies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[21]</ref> and identification of analogies between stories. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">23</ref> These results add to the growing body of work characterizing the emergent capabilities of LLMs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[28]</ref> and suggest that the most sophisticated LLMs may already possess an emergent capacity to reason by analogy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Results</head><p>We evaluated the language model GPT-3 on a set of analogy tasks, and compared its performance to human behavior. GPT-3 is a large-scale (175B parameters), transformer-based <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">29</ref> language model developed by OpenAI. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">13</ref> The original base model was trained on a web-based corpus of natural language consisting of over 400 billion tokens, using a training objective based on next-token prediction (given a string of text, the model is trained to predict the token most likely appear next). A number of variants on this base model have since been developed by fine-tuning it in various ways. These include training the model to generate code, <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">30</ref> and training it to respond appropriately to human prompts, using either supervised learning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31</ref> Our evaluation focused on the most recent model variant, text-davinci-003 (here referred to simply as 'GPT-3'), which was the first to incorporate RLHF (along with the concurrently released, but distinct, ChatGPT model). We found that text-davinci-003 displayed particularly strong performance on our analogy tasks, but earlier model variants also performed well in some task settings, suggesting that multiple factors contributed to text-davinci-003's analogical capabilities (Supplementary Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>). See Section S2 for further discussion.</p><p>Our evaluation featured four separate task domains, each designed to probe different aspects of analogical reasoning: 1) text-based matrix reasoning problems, 2) letter-string analogies, 3) four-term verbal analogies, and 4) story analogies. For each task domain, we performed a direct comparison with human behavior, assessing both overall performance and error patterns across a range of conditions relevant to human analogical reasoning. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows a summary of these results. We also performed a qualitative analysis of GPT-3's ability to use analogical reasoning to solve problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Matrix reasoning problems</head><p>We designed a text-based matrix reasoning task, the Digit Matrices, to emulate the structure of Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM). <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref> The task is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. The dataset was structured similarly to the work of Matzen et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32</ref> who created, and behaviorally validated, a visual matrix reasoning dataset with the same rule structure as the original SPM. The Digit Matrices dataset thus has a similar rule structure to SPM, but is guaranteed to be novel for both humans and LLMs.</p><p>Digit Matrix problems consisted of either digit transformations (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b-2e</ref>) or logic problems (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2f-2g</ref>). Transformation problems were defined based on a set of three rule types -constant (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2c</ref>), distribution-of-3 (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2d</ref>), and progression (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2e</ref>) -and consisted of one or more rules per problem. When multiple rules were present (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref>), each rule was bound to a different spatial location within each cell (e.g., one rule was bound to the left digit in each cell, and another rule was bound to the right digit). Logic problems were defined based on set relations -OR, AND, and XOR -and involved only a single rule per problem. In some logic problems, the corresponding elements were spatially aligned (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2f</ref>), whereas in others they were permuted (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2g</ref>). We hypothesized that spatial alignment would be beneficial when solving the problems via analogical mapping, as it should highlight the isomorphism . <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">33</ref> Digit Matrices problems were presented to GPT-3 without any prompt or in-context task examples.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref> shows zero-shot performance on the Digit Matrices problems for GPT-3 and human participants (N=40, UCLA undergraduates). GPT-3 surpassed the average level of human performance on all problem types, both when generating answers directly (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3a</ref>; logistic regression, main effect of GPT-3 vs. human participants: odds ratio (OR) = 1.88, p = 0.005, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = [1.21, 2.91]), and when selecting from a set of answer choices (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3b</ref>; main effect of GPT-3 vs. human participants: OR = 6.27, p = 2.3 × 10 -8 , CI = [3.28, 11.99]). It is worth emphasizing, however, that participants displayed a range of performance levels on this task, with some participants outperforming GPT-3 (indeed, the best participant answered every problem correctly).</p><p>In addition to showing strong overall performance, GPT-3's pattern of performance across problem subtypes was similar to that observed in human participants (correlation analysis: r(30) = 0.39, p = 0.027). This correlation was driven both by the pattern of performance across major problem types (one-, two-, three-rule, and logic problems; main effect of problem type on generative accuracy: OR = 0.5, p = 2 × 10 -16 , CI = [0.44, 0.56],; main effect of problem type on multiple-choice accuracy: OR = 0.56, p = 2 × 10 -16 , CI = [0.5, 0.64]), and by differences within each problem type. Problems with progression rules were more difficult than those without them (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3c</ref>; main effect of progression vs. no progression, human participants: OR = 0.41, p = 0.0001, CI = [0.24, 0.69]; GPT-3: OR = 0.07, p = 1.9 × 10 -5 , CI = [0.02, 0.24]); for multi-rule problems, performance was negatively correlated with the number of unique rules in each problem, even when holding constant the number of total rules (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3d</ref>; main effect of number of unique rules, human participants: OR = 0.61, p = 0.0047, CI = [0.44, 0.86]; GPT-3: OR = 0.25, p = 3 × 10 -10 , CI = [0.17, 0.39]); and logic problems were more difficult when the corresponding elements were spatially permuted vs. aligned (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3e</ref>; main effect of spatial alignment, human participants: OR = 0.52, p = 0.0017, CI = [0.35, 0.79]; GPT-3: OR = 0.06, p = 2×10 -11 , CI = [0.03, 0.14]). These effects replicate well-known characteristics of human analogical reasoning: problems defined by relations (e.g., progression) are typically more difficult than problems defined by the features of individual entities (e.g., constant or distribution-of-3); <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">34</ref> problem difficulty is typically driven by the degree of relational complexity, as defined by the number of unique relations; <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">35</ref> and analogical mapping is easier when a greater number of constraints supports the correct mapping (as is the case in the spatially aligned logic problems). <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">33</ref> GPT-3's pattern of performance thus displayed many of the characteristics of a human-like analogical mapping process. We also found that GPT-3 was sensitive to contextual information in ways that both improved and impaired its performance, similar to human reasoners (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>).</p><p>It is important to highlight the differences between the Digit Matrices and traditional visual matrix reasoning problems.

In the illustrated example, the digits in the second column are formed from the union of the sets in the first and third columns. This example illustrates how the spatial alignment of the corresponding elements can make it easier to intuitively grasp the underlying rule.

Other logic problems were governed either by an AND rule or an XOR rule (not pictured).</p><p>parsed and disentangled, essentially providing GPT-3 (which is not capable of visual processing) with pseudo-symbolic inputs. Interestingly, despite these significant differences, we found that overall error rates for human participants were very similar for the Digit Matrices vs. the original image-based SPM problem set, and showed a similar pattern across problem types (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). These results suggest that, while the Digit Matrices do not engage the visual processes involved in traditional SPM problems (i.e., deriving disentangled representations from pixel-level inputs), they likely engage a similar set of core reasoning processes (i.e., inducing abstract rules from those representations). More generally, performance on verbal, visuospatial, and mathematical analogy problems are known to be highly correlated for people. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">5</ref> Accordingly, GPT-3's success on the Digit Matrices can be taken as evidence that it has acquired core capabilities underlying analogy, though it will be important in future work to investigate how these reasoning processes might be integrated with visual processing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Letter string analogies</head><p>A central feature of human analogical reasoning is its flexibility. Human reasoners are capable of identifying abstract similarities between situations even when these situations are superficially quite different. Often this involves a process of re-representation, in which an initial problem representation is revised so as to facilitate the discovery of an analogy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[37]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[38]</ref> Hofstadter and Mitchell <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">39</ref> introduced the letter string analogy domain to evaluate computational models of analogical reasoning, with a particular emphasis on the process of re-representation. The basic problem structure is illustrated in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>. In this example, the source string 'a b c d' has been transformed by converting the final letter to its successor, resulting in the string 'a b c e'. This transformation must be identified, and then applied to the target string 'i j k l', yielding the answer 'i j k m'.</p><p>Though this example is simple, letter string problems can be made quite complex by introducing various generalizations between the source and target strings. For instance, the target may involve groups of letters rather than individual letters (e.g., 'i i j j k k l l'), or may involve a sequence with a reversed order relative to the source (e.g., 'l k j i'). In these cases, the transformation identified in the source (e.g., a successor transformation applied to the final letter in the sequence) must be generalized to an analogous transformation (e.g., a successor transformation applied to the final group of letters, or a predecessor transformation applied to the first letter). This feature makes letter string analogy problems well-suited to test the capacity for re-representation.</p><p>To evaluate GPT-3, we created a novel letter string problem set (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5</ref>), and carried out a systematic comparison with human participants (N=57, UCLA undergraduates). The problem set involved a range of different transformation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5d</ref>) and generalization types (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5e</ref>). Each transformation type could be combined with any generalization type, and multiple generalization types could be combined together to yield more challenging problems (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>). Problems were presented to GPT-3 along with a prompt ('Let's try to complete the pattern:'), using a format similar to the Digit Matrices.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref> shows the results of this evaluation. GPT-3 showed stronger overall performance than human participants (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6a</ref>; logistic regression, main effect of GPT-3 vs. human participants: OR = 1.76, p = 6.3 × 10 -5 , CI = [1.34, 2.31]), an effect that was driven primarily by stronger performance on zero-generalization problems (main effect of GPT-3 vs. human participants for zero-generalization problems: OR = 1.76, p = 0.0007, CI = [1.27, 2.46]). Performance was strongly affected by the number of generalizations in both GPT-3 and human participants (main effect of number of generalizations, GPT-3: OR = 0.51, p = 2 × 10 -16 , CI = [0.45, 0.57]; human participants: OR = 0.66, p = 5.9 × 10 -16 , CI = [0.6, 0.73]). GPT-3 and human participants also showed similar error patterns across transformation types (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6b</ref>) and generalization types (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6c</ref>), as quantified by a correlation analysis for accuracy across different problem subtypes (r(39) = 0.7, p = 3.6 × 10 -7 ).</p><p>We also investigated a novel variant on letter string problems involving generalization from letters to real-world concepts (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5c</ref>). GPT-3 showed strong performance on these problems, though with some discrepancies for different transformation types (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6d</ref>). These results suggest that GPT-3 has developed an abstract notion of successorship that can be flexibly generalized between different domains (e.g., alphabetic successorship vs. temper-  (c) Problem involving generalization from letters to real-world concepts. (d) Transformations were sampled from set of six possible types: sequence extension, successor transformation (applied to the last letter in the string), predecessor transformation (applied to the first letter in the string), removal of a redundant letter, 'fixing' an alphabetic sequence (replacing an out-of-place letter), and sorting. (e) Generalizations were sampled from set of six possible types: letter-to-number, grouping, longer target string, reversed order, interleaved distractors, and larger interval.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>ature successorship).</head><p>One important caveat is that GPT-3's performance on this task was somewhat sensitive to the way in which problems were formatted. For instance, performance suffered when no prompt was provided (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5a</ref>), or when problems were presented in the form of a complete sentence (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">5b</ref>). However, even in these cases, GPT-3's zero-shot performance was both within the range of human participants (within one standard deviation), and closely matched the pattern of human performance across problem types (correlation analysis, no prompt: r(39) = 0.6, p = 5.3 × 10 -5 , sentence format: r(39) = 0.76, p = 4.2 × 10 -6 ).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Four-term verbal analogies</head><p>Though matrix reasoning and letter string analogies involve a high degree of relational complexity, one limitation is that they consist of highly constrained, synthetic relations, such as alphabetic or numerical successorship. GPT-3's ability to solve problems involving more real-world concepts (e.g., 'a b c → a b d, cold cool warm → ?') suggests that its analogical capabilities may not be limited to such artificial settings. To further evaluate GPT-3's capacity to reason about real-world relational concepts, we tested it on four-term verbal analogy problems involving a broader range of semantic relations. We evaluated GPT-3 on four separate datasets. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[21]</ref> To the best of our knowledge, these constitute an exhaustive set of four-term verbal analogy problems for which human behavioral data is available. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">41</ref> Each dataset contains a series of four-term analogy problems in the form 'A:B::C:?', together with a set of answer choices (i.e., potential choices of D). For each problem, GPT-3 was evaluated by presenting the problem together with each potential answer choice, and selecting the option for which GPT-3 assigned a higher log probability. The problem and GPT-3's choice were then appended to the context window for the next problem, thereby simulating any contextual effects that might arise when solving multiple problems in a row, as human participants typically do.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7</ref> shows the results for all datasets. GPT-3 performed as well or better than human participants (minimum education level of high-school graduation, located in the United States and recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk) on the UCLA Verbal Analogy Test (VAT), <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">17</ref> involving categorical, functional, antonym, and synonym relations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7a</ref>), and on a dataset from Sternberg and Nigro 19 involving these same four relation types and linear order relations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7b</ref>). On a dataset of SAT analogy problems from Turney et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">20</ref> GPT-3 surpassed the estimated average level of performance for high school students taking the SAT (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7c</ref>). GPT-3 also showed performance in the same range as human participants (though numerically weaker) on a problem set from Jones et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">21</ref> involving categorical, compositional, and causal relations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7d</ref>).</p><p>In addition to displaying generally strong performance on these problem sets, GPT-3 also displayed sensitivity to semantic content similar to that observed in human participants. In the dataset from Jones et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">21</ref> (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">7d</ref>), participants performed worse on problems in which the analogs were semantically distant (i.e., the A and B terms had low semantic similarity to C and D), an effect that was also displayed by GPT-3 (logistic regression, effect of semantic distance for GPT-3: OR = 3.24, p = 0.0165, CI = [1.24, 8.5]). These results align with a more general phenomenon in which human reasoning is facilitated by semantically meaningful or coherent content. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">42</ref> Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>: Story analogy results.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Story analogies</head><p>Human reasoners are able not only to form analogies between individual concepts, but can also identify correspondences between complex real-world events, involving many entities and relations. When making such comparisons, human reasoning is especially sensitive to higher-order relations -relations between relations -notably causal relations between events. Such higher-order relations play a central role in some cognitive theories of analogy, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">43</ref> and it is thus important to establish whether GPT-3 displays a similar sensitivity to them.</p><p>To address this question, we tested GPT-3 on a set of story analogies from Gentner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">18</ref> In each set, a source story is compared to two potential target stories, each of which is matched with the source story in terms of first-order relations, but only one of which shares the same causal relations as the source (see Methods Section 4.6.1 for examples). Gentner et al. found that human participants rated the target stories as more similar when they shared the same causal relations as the source story. These problems are further defined by two different comparison conditions. In the near analogy condition (referred to as 'literal similarity' vs. 'mere appearance' by Gentner et al.), the target stories also share the same basic entities as the source story, making for a less abstract, within-domain comparison. In the far analogy condition (referred to as 'true analogy' vs. 'false analogy' by Gentner et al.), the target stories involve different entities from the source story, but share first-order relations, resulting in a more challenging, cross-domain comparison.</p><p>To facilitate a direct comparison with GPT-3, we performed a new behavioral study with these materials. For each source story, participants indicated which of two target stories was more analogous. Both GPT-3 and human participants (N=54, UCLA undergraduates) showed a sensitivity to higher-order relations (Figure <ref type="figure">8</ref>), most often selecting the target story that shared causal relations with the source (combined near and far analogy; GPT-3, binomial test: p = 0.0005; human participants, one-sample t-test: t(53) = 21.3, p = 1.1 × 10 -27 ; null hypotheses for both tests is chance-level performance of 0.5). This effect was significant for both GPT-3 and human participants in the near analogy condition (GPT-3, binomial test: p = 0.0039; human participants, one-sample t-test: t(53) = 21.5, p = 8.5 × 10 -28 ), but only human participants showed a significant effect in the far analogy condition (GPT-3, binomial test: p = 0.065; human participants, one-sample t-test: t(53) = 16.7, p = 9.3 × 10 -23 ).</p><p>Unlike the other task domains considered in the present work, this was a case in which college students clearly outperformed GPT-3 (logistic regression, main effect of GPT-3 vs. human participants: OR = 0.37, p = 0.0003, CI = [0.21, 0.63]). Indeed, a significant number of participants (15/54) selected the analogous story on every trial. However, in an initial investigation of GPT-4, <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">44</ref> we found that it displays stronger performance on this task, more robustly picking the analogous story even in the far analogy condition, and displaying nearly perfect performance in the near analogy condition (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">6</ref>, Section S4.3). It therefore seems likely that further scaling of large language models will enhance their sensitivity to causal relations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.5">Analogical problem-solving</head><p>In everyday thinking and reasoning, analogical comparisons are often made for the purpose of achieving some goal, or solving a novel problem. Thus far, our tests of GPT-3 have assessed its capacity for identifying analogies in textbased inputs with varying formats, but can GPT-3 also use these analogies to derive solutions to novel problems, as human reasoners do?</p><p>As a preliminary investigation of this issue, we performed a qualitative evaluation using a paradigm developed by Gick and Holyoak. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">22</ref> In that paradigm, participants are presented with a target problem in the form of a story. In the original study, Duncker's radiation problem was used. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">45</ref> In that problem, a doctor wants to use radiation to destroy a malignant tumor, but destroying the tumor with a single high-intensity ray will also damage the surrounding healthy tissue. The solution -to use several low-intensity rays that converge at the site of the tumor -is rarely identified spontaneously, but participants are more likely to discover this solution when they are first presented with an analogous source story. In the original study, the source story involved a general who wants to capture a fortress ruled by an evil dictator, but cannot do so by sending his entire army along a single road, which would trigger landmines. The general instead breaks his army up into small groups that approach the fortress from multiple directions, thus avoiding triggering the mines.</p><p>We first presented GPT-3 with the target problem in isolation. GPT-3 proposed a solution that involved injecting a radiation source directly into the tumor, rather than identifying the intended solution based on the convergence of multiple low-intensity radiation sources (Supplementary Section S5.1). However, when first presented with the general story, followed by the target problem, GPT-3 correctly identified the convergence solution (Supplementary Section S5.2). GPT-3 was further able to correctly explain the analogy, and to identify the specific correspondences between the source story and target problem when prompted (e.g., general ↔ doctor, dictator ↔ tumor, army ↔ rays). We also found similar results when using distinct source analogs taken from another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">46</ref> (Supplementary Section S5.3).</p><p>In a more challenging version of this paradigm, participants were first presented with both the general story, and two other non-analogous stories intended to serve as distractors. In this context, human participants were much less likely to identify the convergence solution. However, when given a prompt to explicitly consider the previously presented stories when trying to solve the radiation problem, participants were often able to correctly identify the analogous general story, and use this analogy to devise the convergence solution. Remarkably, we found that GPT-3 displayed these same effects. When presented with these same distracting, non-analogous stories, GPT-3 no longer identified the convergence solution, instead proposing the same solution that it proposed in response to the radiation problem alone (Supplementary Section S5.4). But when prompted to consider the previous stories, GPT-3 both correctly identified the general story as most relevant, and proposed the convergence solution (Supplementary Section S5.5).</p><p>We also evaluated GPT-3 using materials from a developmental study that employed a similar paradigm. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">23</ref> In that study, children were tasked with transferring gumballs from one bowl to another bowl that was out of reach, and provided with a number of materials for doing so (e.g., a posterboard, an aluminum walking cane, a cardboard tube), permitting multiple possible solutions. The key result was that when children were first presented with an analogous source story (about a magical genie trying to transfer jewels between two bottles), they were more likely to identify a solution to the target problem that was analogous to the events described in the source story.</p><p>When presented with this target problem, GPT-3 mostly proposed elaborate, but mechanically nonsensical solutions, with many extraneous steps, and no clear mechanism by which the gumballs would be transferred between the two bowls (Supplementary Sections S5.6-S5.8). However, when asked to explicitly identify an analogy between the source story and target problem, GPT-3 was able to identify all of the major correspondences, even though it could not use this analogy to discover an appropriate solution. This finding suggests that GPT-3's difficulty with this problem likely stems from its lack of physical reasoning skills, rather than being due to a difficulty with analogical mapping per se. It is also worth noting that in the original study, this task was presented to children with real physical objects, which likely aided the physical reasoning process relative to the purely text-based input provided to GPT-3. Overall, these results provide some evidence that GPT-3 is capable of using analogies for the purposes of problem-solving, but its ability to do so is constrained by the content about which it can reason, with particular difficulty in the domain of physical reasoning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Discussion</head><p>We have presented an extensive evaluation of analogical reasoning in a state-of-the-art large language model. We found that GPT-3 appears to display an emergent ability to reason by analogy, matching or surpassing human performance across a wide range of text-based problem types. These included a novel problem set (Digit Matrices) modeled closely on Raven's Progressive Matrices, where GPT-3 both outperformed human participants, and captured a number of specific signatures of human behavior across problem types. Because we developed the Digit Matrix task specifically for this evaluation, we can be sure GPT-3 had never been exposed to problems of this type, and therefore was performing zero-shot reasoning. GPT-3 also displayed an ability to solve analogies based on more meaningful relations, including four-term verbal analogies and analogies between stories describing complex real-world events.</p><p>It is certainly not the case that GPT-3 mimics human analogical reasoning in all respects. Our tests were limited to processes that can be carried out within a local temporal context, but humans are also capable of retrieving potential source analogs from long-term memory, and ultimately of developing new concepts based on the comparison of multiple analogs. Unlike humans, GPT-3 does not have long-term memory for specific episodes. It is therefore unable to search for previously-encountered situations that might create useful analogies with a current problem. For example, GPT-3 can use the general story to guide its solution to the radiation problem, but as soon as its context buffer is emptied, it reverts to giving its non-analogical solution to the problem -the system has learned nothing from processing the analogy. GPT-3's reasoning ability is also limited by its lack of physical understanding of the world, as evidenced by its failure (in comparison with human children) to use an analogy to solve a transfer problem involving construction and use of simple tools. GPT-3's difficulty with this task is likely due at least in part to its purely text-based input, lacking the multimodal experience necessary to build a more integrated world model. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">47</ref> Finally, we found GPT-3 was limited in its ability to evaluate analogies based on causal relations, particularly in cross-domain comparisons between stories (far analogy).</p><p>But despite these major caveats, our evaluation reveals that GPT-3 exhibits a very general capacity to identify and generalize -in zero-shot fashion -relational patterns to be found within both formal problems and meaningful texts. These results are extremely surprising. It is commonly held that although neural networks can achieve a high level of performance within a narrowly-defined task domain, they cannot robustly generalize what they learn to new problems in the way that human learners do. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[50]</ref> Analogical reasoning is typically viewed as a quintessential example of this human capacity for abstraction and generalization, allowing human reasoners to intelligently approach novel problems zero-shot. Our results indicate that GPT-3 -unlike any other neural network previously tested on analogy problems -displays a capacity for such zero-shot analogical reasoning across a broad range of tasks.</p><p>The deep question that now arises is how GPT-3 achieves the analogical capacity that is often considered the core of human intelligence. One possibility is that, perhaps as a result of the sheer size and diversity of GPT-3's training data, it has been forced to develop mechanisms similar to those thought to underlie human analogical reasoningdespite not being explicitly trained to do so. The consensus among cognitive scientists working on analogy is that this human ability depends on systematic comparison of knowledge based on explicit relational representations. It is unclear whether and how GPT-3 would implement these processes. Does GPT-3 possess some form of emergent relational representations, and if so, how are they computed? Does it perform a mapping process similar to the type that plays a central role in cognitive theories of analogy <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">43</ref> ?</p><p>A few properties of the transformer architecture, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">29</ref> on which GPT-3 and other large language models are based, are worth considering here. The first is the central role played by similarity. Transformers are built on a self-attention operation, which involves explicitly computing the similarity between each pair of vectors in the inputs to each layer. This pairwise evaluation of similarity is also a key feature of cognitive models of analogy, where it provides the primary constraint guiding the process of analogical mapping. In traditional symbolic models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">51</ref> this takes the form of literal identicality between symbols, but in more recent models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">53</ref> a graded similarity function that operates over vector-based inputs is used, much like the self-attention operation in transformers. Second, transformer self-attention employs a form of indirection, in which one set of embeddings is used to reference another set of embeddings (i.e., keys vs. values) -arguably a form of variable binding. Cognitive scientists have long hypothesized that variable binding plays a central role in analogical reasoning, and abstract reasoning more broadly, as it potentially allows generalization of abstract roles across different contexts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[54]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[55]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[56]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[57]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[58]</ref> It may be that these features of the transformer make it better equipped to perform zero-shot reasoning than other neural architectures. This possibility aligns with recent evidence that the transformer architecture is an important factor contributing toward the emergence of few-shot learning. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">27</ref> But although the mechanisms incorporated into large language models such as GPT-3 may have some important links to building blocks of human reasoning, we must also entertain the possibility that this type of machine intelligence is fundamentally different from the human variety. Humans have evolved to reason within bounds imposed by limited computational power and biological constraints . <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">59</ref> Thus, we tend to approach complex problems by breaking them into a set of simpler problems that can be solved separately, <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">60</ref> an approach that plays a particularly important role in solving challenging analogy problems such as Raven's Matrices. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">61</ref> It is possible that GPT-3, through sheer computational scale, is able to solve such complex problems in a holistic and massively parallel manner, without the need to segment them into more manageable components.</p><p>It must also be noted that, regardless of the extent to which GPT-3 employs human-like mechanisms to perform analogical reasoning, we can be certain that it did not acquire these mechanisms in a human-like manner. LLMs receive orders of magnitude more training data than do individual human beings (at least if we consider linguistic inputs alone), <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">59</ref> and so they cannot be considered as models of the acquisition of analogical reasoning over the course of human development. Nor can they be considered good models of the evolution of analogical reasoning, as their analogical abilities are derived entirely from being trained to predict human-generated text. Human natural language is replete with analogies; accurately predicting natural language therefore likely requires an ability to appreciate analogies. But there is no reason to suppose that the same system, absent human-generated inputs, would spontaneously develop a disposition to think analogically, as apparently happened at some point in human evolution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">62</ref> Thus, to the extent that large language models capture the analogical abilities of adult human reasoners, their capacity to do so is fundamentally parasitic on natural human intelligence. Nevertheless, the present results indicate that this approach may be sufficient to approximate human-like reasoning abilities, albeit through a radically different route than that taken by biological intelligence.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.1">Dataset</head><p>The digit matrix problems consisted of two major problem categories: transformation and logic problems. Transformation problems contained anywhere from one to five rules, whereas logic problems each contained only a single rule. Transformation problems were defined using a combination of three rule types: constant, distribution-of-3, and progression. The constant rule was defined by the same digit appearing across either rows or columns. The following example shows an instance of a column-wise constant rule (correct answer: '9'):</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">[5] [1] [9] [5] [1] [9] [5] [1] [?]</formula><p>The distribution-of-3 rule was defined by the same set of three digits appearing in each row or column, but with the order permuted. In the following example, the digits 6, 2, and 4 appear in each row (correct answer: '2'):</p><p>In the AND rule, a particular row or column contained only entities that appeared in both of the other rows or columns. In the following example, the left column contains only digits that appear in both the left and middle columns (correct answer: '9'): For some logic problems, the within-cell spatial position of corresponding elements was aligned, as in the previously presented OR and AND problems. In other logic problems, corresponding elements were spatially permuted. The following example (involving an OR rule) illustrates how this makes it more difficult to intuitively grasp the underlying rule (correct answer: '0'):</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">[ 1] [7 1 ] [7 ] [1 0] [5 0 7 1] [7 5] [0 ] [ 0 5] [ ? ]</formula><p>Within each problem type (one-through five-rule and logic problems), there were a number of specific problem subtypes. There were 6 one-rule subtypes, 6 two-rule subtypes, and 10 subtypes for three-rule, four-rule, five-rule, and logic problems. We generated 100 instances of each subtype (except in the case of progression problems, for which there were fewer possible problem instances). The one-rule problem subtypes consisted of a row-wise constant problem, a column-wise constant problem, two distribution-of-3 problems, and two progression problems (one with an increment of 1 and one with an increment of 2). The two-and three-rule problem subtypes consisted of all possible combinations of two or three rules (allowing for the same rule to be used multiple times within each problem). The four-and five-rule problem subtypes were sampled from the set of all possible combinations of four or five rules. There were five spatially aligned logic problem subtypes, and five spatially permuted logic problem subtypes. Three out of each of these five subtypes were OR problems (defined by the row or column in which the set union appeared), and the other two were AND and XOR problems.</p><p>For each problem, we also procedurally generated a set of 7 distractor choices, making for a set of 8 total answer choices. Distractors were generated using different methods for the transformation and logic problems. These methods were chosen based on the approach of Matzen et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">32</ref> who performed an analysis of the answer choices in the original SPM. For transformation problems, the following methods were used to generate distractors:</p><p>1. Sample a random cell from the problem.</p><p>2. Sample a random cell from the problem, sample a random digit within that cell, and apply an increment or decrement of either 1 or 2.</p><p>3.

Randomly sample a previously generated distractor for this problem, apply an increment or decrement of either 1 or 2 to a randomly sampled digit.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Randomly generate a new answer choice (with the appropriate number of digits given the problem type).</head><p>For multi-rule transformation problems, the following additional methods were also used:</p><p>1.

For spatially aligned logic problems, the order of the elements within each distractor was chosen so as to be consistent with the order that they appeared in the problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.2">Human behavioral experiments</head><p>Human behavioral data was collected in two online experiments. All experiments were approved by the UCLA Institutional Review Board (IRB protocol #22-000841, approved May 17, 2022), and all participants provided informed consent. All participants were UCLA undergraduates. Forty-three participants completed the first experiment, but three participants were excluded from analysis due to the fact that they got nearly every answer incorrect, and produced an apparently random pattern of responses (e.g. random permutations of the same three digits for all problems). The remaining 40 participants (31 female, 18-35 years old, average age = 21.3 years old) were included in our analysis. Forty-seven participants (37 female, 18-42 years old, average age = 21.2 years old) completed the second experiment. No statistical methods were used to pre-determine sample sizes. There was no overlap between the participants in the first and second experiments. Participants received course credit for their participation.</p><p>In both experiments, participants were first presented with a set of instructions, and a single one-rule example problem involving a constant rule. For each problem, participants first generated a free-response answer, and then selected from the set of answer choices. Problems were presented in a spatially arranged matrix format, as they appear in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2</ref>. Problems remained on the screen until participants made a response.</p><p>In the first experiment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>), participants were presented with one-, two-, three-rule, and logic problems. There were 6 problem subtypes each for the one-and two-rule problems, and 10 problem subtypes each for the threerule and logic problems, making for 32 problem subtypes in total. Participants received these problem subtypes in random order. Each participant received randomly sampled instances of each problem subtype.</p><p>In the second experiment (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>), participants were presented with one-through five-rule problems. There were 6 problem subtypes each for the one-and two-rule problems, and 10 problem subtypes each for the three-through five-rule problems, making for 42 problem subtypes in total. Problems were presented in order of increasing complexity, with all one-rule problem subtypes first, followed by all two-rule problem subtypes, and so on. For one-rule problems, the two constant problems were presented first, followed by the two distribution-of-3 problems, followed by the two progression problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.3">Evaluating GPT-3</head><p>GPT-3 was evaluated on the Digit Matrices by presenting each complete problem as a prompt, including brackets and line breaks, followed by an open bracket at the start of the final cell. For example, the three-rule problem in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">2b</ref> would be presented to GPT-3 in the following format: GPT-3's generated responses were truncated at the point where a closing bracket was generated. For logic problems, generated answers were counted as correct if they contained the correct set of digits, regardless of their order. For transformation problems, generated answers were only counted as correct if they contained the correct digits in the correct order. The same criteria were applied when evaluating human responses.</p><p>To evaluate GPT-3's multiple-choice performance, for each answer choice, the choice was appended to the problem followed by a closing bracket, and presented to GPT-3 as a prompt. The average log probability of the tokens corresponding to the answer choice (not counting the brackets) was computed. The answer choice with the highest average log probability was treated as GPT-3's selection.</p><p>In our primary evaluation (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>), GPT-3 was presented with 40 problem instances from each of the 32 problem subtypes used in the first human behavioral experiment. GPT-3 solved each one zero-shot (without any fine-tuning or in-context learning).</p><p>We also evaluated how GPT-3 performed when presented with problems in order of increasing complexity (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref>). GPT-3 performed 20 runs on this task. For each run, GPT-3 was presented with a series of the same 42 problem subtypes used in the second human behavioral experiment (with different instances of these subtypes in each run). After GPT-3 answered each problem, the selected multiple-choice answer was appended to the problem, and the combined problem and answer choice were recursively appended to the prompt for the next problem. This meant that the size of the prompt grew with each problem. For some of the final five-rule problems, the prompt exceeded the size of GPT-3's context window (4096 tokens). When this occurred, problems from the beginning of the context window were deleted until the entire prompt fit within the window. This resulted in the deletion of a few one-rule problems from the beginning of the prompt. For one-rule problems, the two constant problems were presented first, followed by the two distribution-of-3 rules, followed by the two progression problems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.4">Statistical analyses</head><p>Results were analyzed using both regression and correlation analyses. Logistic regression analyses were carried out at the individual trial level, with each data point corresponding to a particular trial from a particular participant (or GPT-3). The dependent variable in all regression analyses was a binary variable coding for whether a particular response was correct or incorrect.</p><p>For the first digit matrix experiment, we fit separate regression models for generative vs. multiple-choice responses. Two predictors were used: problem type (one-, two-, three-rule, and logic problems), and a binary predictor coding for GPT-3 vs. human participants. We also performed more fine-grained analyses for generative responses within each problem type. These analyses were performed separately for GPT-3 vs. human responses. For two-rule problems, a single binary predictor coded for whether a problem contained a progression rule. For three-rule problems, a single predictor coded for the number of unique rules present in a given problem.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4.1">Problem set</head><p>Each letter string analogy problem involved one of six transformation types: sequence extension, successor, predecessor, removing a redundant letter, fixing an alphabetic sequence, and sorting. In the sequence extension transformation, the source involved an alphabetically ordered sequence of four letters followed by an extension of this sequence involving five letters, as in the following example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">[a b c d] [a b c d e]</formula><p>In the successor transformation, the source involved an alphabetically ordered sequence of four letters, followed by that same sequence, but with the final letter replaced by its successor, as in the following example: In the predecessor transformation, the source involved an alphabetically ordered sequence of four letters, followed by that same sequence, but with the first letter replaced by its predecessor, as in the following example:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[b c d e] [a c d e]</head><p>In the transformation involving removal of a redundant letter, the source involved an alphabetically ordered sequence of five letters with one letter repeated, followed by that same sequence with the redundant letter removed, as in the following example: In the transformation involving fixing an alphabetic sequence, the source involved an alphabetically ordered sequence of five letters with one out-of-place letter (not part of the alphabetic sequence), followed by that same sequence with the out-of-place letter replaced, as in the following example: In the sorting transformation, the source involved an alphabetically ordered sequence of five letters with the position of two letters swapped, followed by a sorted version of the same sequence, as in the following example:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[a d c b e] [a b c d e]</head><p>Problems involved varying degrees of generalization between the source and target. In the zero-generalization problems, the target involved a different instance of the source transformation (instantiated with different letters). Transformation parameters (e.g., the location of the redundant letter) were independently sampled for source and target.</p><p>Generalization problems involved generalizations sampled from the following set of generalization types: generalization from letters to numbers, grouping, generalization to a longer target, reversed order, interleaved distractors, and generalization to a larger interval. In the letter-to-number generalization, target letters were replaced by numbers corresponding to their alphabetic indices, as in the following example: In the grouping generalization, target letters were replaced by groups with two instances of each letter, as in the following example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">[a b c d] [a b c d e] [i i j j k k l l] [ ? ]</formula><p>In the longer target generalization, the target sequence was replaced with a sequence that was twice as long as the source, as in the following example:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[a b c d] [a b c d e] [i j k l m n o p] [ ? ]</head><p>In the reversed order generalization, the order of the target letters was reversed relative to the source, as in the following example:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">[a b c d] [a b c d e] [l k j i] [ ? ]</formula><p>In the interleaved distractor generalization, the letter 'x' was interleaved between each letter in the target sequence, as in the following example:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[a b c d] [a b c d e] [i x j x k x l x] [ ? ]</head><p>In the larger interval generalization, the sequence of target letters was replaced with a sequence involving an interval of size 2, as in the following example: Each transformation type could be combined with any generalization type. Multiple generalizations could also be combined together. Generalization problems contained between one and three generalizations. We generated a set of 600 zero-generalization problems (involving 100 problems with each transformation type), 600 one-generalization problems (involving 100 problems with each generalization type, with randomly sampled transformation type), and 600 problems each with two and three generalizations (with randomly sampled combinations of transformation and generalization type).</p><p>We also generated a separate set of problems involving generalization from letters to real-world concepts. In these problems, the source instantiated a transformation using letters, and the target instantiated that same transformation using real-world instances of successorship. These problems involved shorter sequences (maximum length of four), due to the difficulty of identifying real-world instances of successorship with more than four points. The following sequences were used: cold cool warm hot love like dislike hate jack queen king ace penny nickel dime quarter second minute hour day</p><p>The transformation types included sequence extension, successor, predecessor, and sorting.

The presentation format is illustrated in the following example: GPT-3's generated responses were truncated at the point where a closing bracket was generated.

We also fit regression models at each generalization level with a single binary predictor coding for GPT-3 vs. human participants. For real-world concept problems, a regression model was fit with a predictor coding for GPT-3 vs. human participants.</p><p>For correlation analyses, problem subtypes were defined based on each combination of transformation type and generalization type. The accuracy for each subtype was computed for GPT-3 vs. human participants, and these values were subjected to correlation analysis. There were only a few examples of some problem subtypes (across all participants), especially for problems with more generalizations (the space of possible subtypes grows exponentially with the number of generalizations).

At lower intensities the rays will not damage the healthy tissue, but neither will they remove the tumor. How can the doctor use rays to destroy the tumor, while at the same time sparing the healthy tissue? Solution:</p><p>The doctor can use a technique called brachytherapy. This involves placing a radioactive source directly into the tumor. The radiation from the source will be of a high enough intensity to destroy the tumor, but the radiation will not travel far enough to damage the healthy tissue. The doctor can also use a technique called stereotactic radiotherapy. This involves using a machine to deliver a high-intensity beam of radiation to the tumor from outside the body.

To do so, he uses a magic staff to pull the new bottle over next to the old bottle and transfers the jewels by hand.

So he began searching far and wide for another bottle. Finally he found the perfect home. It was larger, prettier, and not too far away from his old bottle. The genie was very excited and began moving his belongings right away. But now the genie had a problem. He had a great many beautiful and very precious jewels in his old home. He had to somehow get all the jewels from his old bottle to the new bottle without dropping or losing a single jewel.</p><p>After thinking a bit, the genie came up with a wonderful idea. He began searching for his magic staff, or wand. He then commanded his staff to stretch itself from his old home to his new home. Next, the genie tugged and pulled on his magical staff until at last he pulled the new bottle right up next to his old bottle. At once, the genie began gathering his jewels together in his old home and simply dropped them carefully into his new home right next to him. When all his jewels were safely tucked away in his new home, the genie settled in happily. He invited his friend to come in and admire his new home. I'm sure you can still find the genie sitting in his new bigger and better bottle with all his jewels and smiling contentedly even today! Target problem:</p><p>You are seated in front of a table.

Then, the genie very carefully took one jewel from inside his old home and placed it into the opening of his carpet. At once, the jewel began tumbling and rolling through the carpet tube until it reached his new home and plopped safely inside. The genie grinned happily and began rolling all his jewels through the carpet into his new home. In fact, I'm sure you can still find him sitting in his new, bigger and better bottle with all his jewels and smiling contentedly even today! Target problem:</p><p>You are seated in front of a table. Two bowls are on the table, one within your reach and one farther away. The closer bowl contains a number of small gumballs, and the farther one is empty. Also on the table are an aluminum walking cane, a large rectangular sheet of heavy paper (posterboard), a hollow cardboard tube long enough to reach the farther bowl, scissors, string, tape, paper clips, and rubber bands. Using the materials provided, how can you transfer the balls from the filled to the empty bowl without leaving your seat? Solution:</p><p>Take the posterboard and cut it into two pieces. Take one of the pieces and roll it up into a tube. Secure the tube with the rubber bands, tape, and paper clips. Place one end of the tube into the bowl with the gumballs and the other end into the empty bowl. Then, use the walking cane to push the gumballs through the tube until they reach the empty bowl.</p><p>Can you identify an analogy between the source story and the target problem?</p><p>The source story and the target problem both involve transferring items from one place to another. In the source story, the genie transfers jewels from one bottle to another using a flying carpet. In the target problem, the person transfers gumballs from one bowl to another using a posterboard tube. In both cases, the items are transferred without leaving the original location.</p><p>Does this analogy suggest a solution to the target problem?</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Summary of results.

(a) Example problem depicting structure of Raven's Progressive Matrices.<ref type="bibr" target="#b17">15</ref> Problems consist of a 3 × 3 matrix populated with geometric forms, in which each row or column is governed by the same set of abstract rules. Problem solvers must identify these rules, and use them to infer the missing cell in the lower right, by selecting from the set of 8 choices below. (b) Example problem illustrating the novel Digit Matrices problem set. Problems consist of a 3 × 3 matrix, in which each cell is demarcated by brackets, and populated by digits. The problems are governed by the same rule structure as Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. The example problems in (a) and (b) are structurally isomorphic (i.e., governed by the same set of rules). The reader is encouraged to derive the solution to each problem. The solutions to both problems are given in Supplementary Section S1. Problems were governed either by one or more transformation rules (b-e), or by a single logic rule (f,g). (c) Constant rule: same digit appears across either rows or columns. (d) Distribution-of-3 rule: same set of 3 digits appears in each row or column, but with order varied. (e) Progression rule: digits either increase or decrease, by values of 1 or 2, across rows or columns. In the example shown here, digits increase by 2 across rows. (f ) OR rule: the set of digits present in a particular row or column are defined as the union of the sets present in the other rows or columns. In the illustrated example, the digits in the second column are formed from the union of the sets in the first and third columns. This example illustrates how the spatial alignment of the corresponding elements can make it easier to intuitively grasp the underlying rule. (g) More challenging logic problem governed by same rule (OR), but in which the corresponding elements are spatially permuted. Other logic problems were governed either by an AND rule or an XOR rule (not pictured).</figDesc></figure>

There are 20 problems for each relation type. Each problem contains two answer choices for the final term (D and D'). We evaluated GPT-3 by presenting the problem along with each possible answer choice (A:B::C:D or A:B::C:D'), using the standard colon notation, and selected the answer choice for which GPT-3 assigned a higher log probability to the final term.

The largest version (175B parameters) of the base model, davinci, was trained exclusively on next-token prediction using a web-based corpus of text data. Code-davinci-002 was further trained on next-token prediction using a dataset of publicly available code from GitHub. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">30</ref> Text-davinci-002 and text-davinci-003 were both fine-tuned to respond appropriately to prompts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31</ref> Text-davinci-002 was initialized with code-davinci-002, and then fine-tuned using supervised learning based on a set of example prompts and responses. Text-davinci-003 was initialized with text-davinci-002, and then further fine-tuned using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). In RLHF, a reward model (a separate neural network) is first trained to predict human ratings for pairs of human-generated prompts and language-model responses, and this reward model is then used to fine-tune the primary language model through reinforcement learning. More details on the different model variants and training objectives can be found at <ref type="url" target="https://platform.openai.com/docs/model-index-for-researchers">https://platform.openai.com/docs/model-index-for-researchers</ref>. We evaluated all four of these variants on Digit Matrices (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>), letter string analogies (Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref>), and fourterm verbal analogies (Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). Text-davinci-003 displayed the best overall performance, but other model variants performed well on a subset of tasks. For instance, code-davinci-002 performed well on the Digit Matrices and letter string problems. These task domains both involve simple alphanumeric characters and highly regular relational structure, similar to computer code. It therefore seems likely that code-davinci-002's strong performance on these a b Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">4</ref>: GPT-3 shows human-like contextual effects. In a separate experiment, we presented both GPT-3 and human participants (N=47, UCLA undergraduates) with Digit Matrix problems in order of increasing complexity (easy-to-hard: one-rule problems, followed by two-rule problems, and so on). (a) Both GPT-3 and human participants were able to generalize the structure inferred from few-rule problems to more complex many-rule problems, resulting in very little decrease in performance even for five-rule problems (compare with the decrease in performance from one-to three-rule problems seen in Main Text Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref>). (b) One-rule problems were also presented in order of increasing complexity, beginning with constant problems, followed by distribution-of-3 problems, followed by progression problems. Interestingly, this actually impaired performance on progression problems relative to zero-shot (or shuffled) presentation. This was likely due to a tendency to mistake the progression rule for the distribution-of-3 rule in the previously presented problems (which only differ in terms of a single digit). Both GPT-3 and human participants showed this effect. Human results reflect average performance for N=47 participants. Black error bars represent standard error of the mean across participants.

Gray error bars represent 95% binomial confidence intervals for average performance across multiple problems.</p><p>tasks was a consequence of having been trained on code. By contrast, code-davinci-002 performed very poorly on four-term verbal analogies (near chance performance), whereas the original davinci model performed relatively well on these problems. This suggests that code-davinci-002's ability to model synthetic code-like structures may have come at the cost of the ability to process more real-world relational concepts. Text-davinci-002, and especially textdavinci-003, seem to have combined both of these abilities, perhaps as a result of prompt training, though these models may have also received additional fine-tuning on the original language modeling task. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">31</ref> Finally, it seems likely that prompt training improved text-davinci-002 and text-davinci-003's ability to perform tasks without the need for few-shot task demonstrations, therefore making it easier to evaluate these models' latent capabilities in a zero-shot setting.</p><p>We also performed an initial investigation of GPT-4 on the story analogy problems from Gentner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">18</ref> (Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>). GPT-4 showed significant improvement on this task relative to GPT-3, more reliably identifying the target story that shared higher-order relations with the source, and providing more precise explanations (Section S4.3). We were not able to test GPT-4 on the other analogy tasks due to a lack of API access. Very little is known about the details of GPT-4, but it is likely that this improvement stems at least in part from increased scale of both model and training set. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">44</ref> </p></div>

Furthermore, this problem format itself is, to the best of our knowledge, completely novel, and it is thus extremely unlikely that GPT-3 has been trained on similar problems. The letter string problem set that we used was also created specifically for the purposes of our study, and so could not have been included in GPT-3's training data.

The dataset of SAT problems from Turney et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">20</ref> is not publicly available, but has been distributed to a relatively small number of researchers. It is possible that any of these datasets were deliberately included in GPT-3's training data (i.e., as a supplement to the web crawl data).

We found evidence that GPT-3 is familiar with this study (it was able to identify the year of publication, and journal in which it was published), but we did not find any evidence that GPT-3 had memorized the details of the analogy itself. GPT-3 was also able to solve the radiation problem via an analogy with lesser known source stories. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">46</ref> It seems unlikely that GPT-3's success on these problems is due to prior exposure, but these Supplementary Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref>: Story analogy results including test of GPT-4.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S4 Story analogy results</head><p>The following section contains examples of GPT-3's responses to the story analogy problems. GPT-3's responses are presented in bold text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S4.1 Near analogy</head><p>The following contains an example from the near analogy condition. GPT-3 identified the correct answer (Story A).</p><p>Consider the following story: Story 1: Karla, an old hawk, lived at the top of a tall oak tree. One afternoon, she saw a hunter on the ground with a bow and some crude arrows that had no feathers. The hunter took aim and shot at the hawk but missed. Karla knew the hunter wanted her feathers so she glided down to the hunter and offered to give him a few. The hunter was so grateful that he pledged never to shoot at a hawk again. He went off and shot deer instead.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Now consider two more stories:</head><p>Story A: Once there was an eagle named Zerdia who nested on a rocky cliff. One day she saw a sportsman coming with a crossbow and some bolts that had no feathers. The sportsman attacked but the bolts</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S4.3 GPT-4</head><p>The following contains an example response from GPT-4 in the far analogy condition. GPT-4 both identifies the correct answer (Story A), and offers a precise explanation of the analogy.</p><p>Consider the following story: Story 1: William was a patient in a psychiatric hospital who was confined indoors almost all the time. He could never pass the monthly room inspections so he hated them. He spent most of his time daydreaming about food. A few days before the April inspection William's room was still a mess since he had done nothing but daydream. To provide William with an incentive, the nurse promised him some gingerbread from the cookie shop if he scrubbed his room and put it in order once and for all. William was overjoyed. But there was no longer enough time for him to put it in order. As a he did not pass the inspection and did not get any gingerbread. William sulked all day and slammed his door so hard the plaster cracked, but he still didn't get any gingerbread.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Now consider two more stories:</head><p>Story A: Karen always did poorly in high school so she despised it. But she loved vacations. She spent most of her time dreaming about going to Hawaii. Not long before the end of her fourth year Karen was not doing at all well in her classes because she had spent all her time daydreaming. To motivate her, Karen's father promised her that if she did well enough during the next few weeks to graduate from high school he would pay for her trip to Hawaii. This made Karen extremely happy. But she was too far behind in her classes. Consequently she failed too many and did not go to Hawaii.</p><p>Story B: Karen disliked high school so she always had trouble getting passing grades in her classes. Vacations were her favorite part of the school year. Not long before the end of her fourth year of school, Karen was not doing well at all because she despised school. To motivate her, Karen's father promised her a trip to Hawaii if she would just pass enough of her classes to graduate. This made Karen extremely happy. During the last few weeks of school she spent most of her time dreaming about Hawaii and preparing for her trip there. Consequently, she failed to graduate and she did not get to go.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Which of Story A and Story B is a better analogy to Story 1? Is the best answer Story A, Story B, or both are equally analogous?</head><p>The best answer is Story A. Both Story A and Story 1 share the following similarities:</p><p>1. The main characters (William and Karen) are not successful in their respective situations (room inspection and graduating high school) due to spending too much time daydreaming. 2. An incentive is provided to motivate the main characters (gingerbread for William and a trip to Hawaii for Karen). 3. Despite being motivated by the incentive, both characters fail to achieve the desired outcome because they are too far behind in their tasks (cleaning the room and catching up on classes).</p><p>Story B is less analogous to Story 1 because Karen spends her time daydreaming and preparing for the trip instead of focusing on her classes, which leads to her failure to graduate. The cause of her failure is different from that in Story 1, where William fails due to the lack of time to complete the task.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S5 Analogical problem-solving results</head><p>The following sections contain all of the materials used to evaluate analogical reasoning in natural language problemsolving. GPT-3's responses are presented in bold text.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S5.1 Solution to radiation problem in isolation</head><p>The following contains GPT-3's proposed solution to the radiation problem when presented in isolation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Target problem:</head><p>Suppose you were a doctor faced with a patient suffering from a malignant stomach tumor. The tumor is inoperable, and the patient will die unless it is destroyed. There is a kind of ray that will destroy the tumor if the rays reach it at a high intensity. But unfortunately, such high-intensity rays will also destroy the healthy tissue they pass through on the way to the tumor. At lower intensities the rays will not damage the healthy tissue, but neither will they remove the tumor. How can the doctor use rays to destroy the tumor, while at the same time sparing the healthy tissue?</p><p>Solution:</p><p>The doctor can use a technique called brachytherapy, which involves placing a radioactive source directly into or near the tumor. This allows the doctor to deliver a high dose of radiation directly to the tumor, while sparing the healthy tissue around it. The radiation source can be placed in the tumor using a catheter, or it can be placed in a sealed container and placed near the tumor. This technique is often used to treat tumors that are inoperable or too close to vital organs to be safely removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S5.2 Solution to radiation problem following general story</head><p>The following contains GPT-3's proposed solution to the radiation problem when first presented with the general story, along with responses to followup questions that explicitly probe the analogy between the source story and the target problem.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Source story:</head><p>An evil dictator controlled a fortress situated in the center of a small country. Many roads radiated out from the fortress like spokes on a wheel. A general raised an army at the border, vowing to capture the fortress and overthrow the dictator. The general was about to send his entire army down one road to capture the fortress, when he learned that the dictator had mined each road so that although small groups could still pass, a large army would set off an explosion. The general then had a clever idea: he divided his army into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a different road. Upon his signal, each group charged down a different road. All the groups passed safely to the fortress, where the entire army attacked the fortress in full strength. In this way the general captured the fortress and overthrew the dictator.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Target problem:</head><p>Suppose you were a doctor faced with a patient suffering from a malignant stomach tumor. The tumor is inoperable, and the patient will die unless it is destroyed. There is a kind of ray that will destroy the tumor if the rays reach it at a high intensity. But unfortunately, such high-intensity rays will also destroy the healthy tissue they pass through on the way to the tumor. At lower intensities the rays will not damage the healthy tissue, but neither will they remove the tumor. How can the doctor use rays to destroy the tumor, while at the same time sparing the healthy tissue?</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Solution:</head><p>The doctor could divide the rays into small groups and send each group down a different path to the tumor. By using a lower intensity for each group, the rays will not damage the healthy tissue, but when they all reach the tumor at the same time, the combined intensity will be enough to destroy it. The doctor could also use imaging technology to map out the paths of the rays and ensure that they all reach the tumor at the same time.</p><p>Can you identify an analogy between the source story and the target problem?</p><p>The analogy between the source story and the target problem is that both involve a situation in which a large force needs to be divided into smaller groups in order to achieve a desired outcome. In the source story, the general divides his army into small groups in order to avoid setting off the mines and capture the fortress. In the target problem, the doctor needs to divide the rays into smaller groups in order to destroy the tumor without damaging the healthy tissue.</p><p>Who or what in the target problem is most analogous to the general in the source story?</p><p>The doctor in the target problem is most analogous to the general in the source story.</p><p>Both are faced with a difficult situation and must come up with a clever solution in order to achieve their desired outcome. In the source story, the general divides his army into small groups in order to avoid setting off the mines and capture the fortress. In the target problem, the doctor needs to divide the rays into smaller groups in order to destroy the tumor without damaging the healthy tissue.</p><p>Who or what in the target problem is most analogous to the evil dictator in the source story?</p><p>The malignant stomach tumor in the target problem is most analogous to the evil dictator in the source story. Both are obstacles that must be overcome in order to achieve the desired outcome. In the source story, the evil dictator must be overthrown in order for the general to capture the fortress. In the target problem, the malignant stomach tumor must be destroyed in order for the patient to be saved.</p><p>Who or what in the target problem is most analogous to the army in the source story?</p><p>The rays in the target problem are most analogous to the army in the source story. Both are forces that must be divided into smaller groups in order to achieve the desired outcome.</p><p>In the source story, the army is divided into small groups in order to avoid setting off the mines and capture the fortress. In the target problem, the rays must be divided into smaller groups in order to destroy the tumor without damaging the healthy tissue.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S5.3 Solution to radiation problem following alternative source analogs</head><p>We also tested GPT-3 using alternative materials for the source analog taken from a different study. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">46</ref> These stories each involve a solution based on convergence, but differ from the general story used in the original study of Gick and Holyoak. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">22</ref> GPT-3 was also able to identify the convergence solution to the radiation problem when presented with these alternative source analogs. The following contains GPT-3's response to the radiation problem when first presented with an analogous story about a student in a physics lab who uses lasers to repair a lightbulb.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Source story:</head><p>In a physics lab at a major university, a very expensive lightbulb which would emit precisely controlled quantities of light was being used in some experiments. Ruth was the research assistant responsible for operating the sensitive lightbulb. One morning she came into the lab and found to her dismay that the lightbulb no longer worked. She realized that she had forgotten to turn it off the previous night. As a result the lightbulb overheated, and the filament inside the bulb had broken into two parts. The surrounding glass bulb was completely sealed, so there was no way to open it. Ruth knew that the lightbulb could be repaired if a brief, high-intensity laser beam could be used to fuse the two parts of the tumor if the rays reach it at a high intensity. But unfortunately, such high-intensity rays will also destroy the healthy tissue they pass through on the way to the tumor. At lower intensities the rays will not damage the healthy tissue, but neither will they remove the tumor. How can the doctor use rays to destroy the tumor, while at the same time sparing the healthy tissue?</p><p>Solution:</p><p>The doctor could use multiple low-intensity rays from several directions all at once. The rays would converge on the tumor, where their combined effect would be enough to destroy it. Since each spot on the healthy tissue would receive only a low-intensity ray from one source, the healthy tissue would be left intact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>S5.4 Solution to radiation problem with distracting stories</head><p>The following contains GPT-3's proposed solution to the radiation problem when first presented with both the general story and two distracting (i.e., non-analogous) stories. GPT-3 did not identify the convergence solution in this case, instead proposing the same solution as it did when presented with the radiation problem in isolation.</p><p>Story #1 -The Wine Merchants:</p><p>One day a rich man found that his wine cellar was empty. So he sent out messengers to announce a generous offer. The first person to bring the rich man a barrel of wine would be given a brick of solid gold. However, the offer would expire at sundown. Two wine merchants heard the news. Each had a horse-drawn cart loaded with large barrels of wine. They both set out for the duke's palace at once. An hour before sundown they came to a place where the bridge had been washed out by a raging river. The first merchant drove his horses and cart into the flood in a desperate attempt to reach the other side. But the horses were already exhausted and could not fight the current. The cart overturned, and the horses, wine, and driver were washed away. The second merchant tried a different tactic. He poured the wine out of all but one of his barrels, and lashed them together to form a raft; then he loaded the one full barrel, a horse, and himself on top. He set the raft adrift and floated downstream. In a few minutes the raft came to rest on the shore in front of the town where the rich man lived. The merchant disembarked, loaded the wine barrel on the horse, and led it to the rich man's house. He arrived just as the sun was setting, and collected the gold brick as a reward for his efforts.</p><p>Story #2 -The General:</p><p>An evil dictator controlled a fortress situated in the center of a small country. Many roads radiated out from the fortress like spokes on a wheel. A general raised an army at the border, vowing to capture the fortress and overthrow the dictator. The general was about to send his entire army down one road to capture the fortress, when he learned that the dictator had mined each road so that although small groups could still pass, a large army would set off an explosion. The general then had a clever idea: he divided his army into small groups and dispatched each group to the head of a different road. Upon his signal, each group charged down a different road. All the groups passed safely to the fortress, where the entire army attacked the fortress in full strength. In this way the general captured the fortress and overthrew the dictator.</p><p>Story #3 -The Identical Twins:</p><p>Once there were identical twins who were continually playing pranks on their family, friends, and teachers. The annual school picnic was always a big event for the twins. There were races and other athletic events in which the twins won lots of prizes. One year a new student arrived who was a star runner. The twins wanted to win the main event: the 2-mile race through the woods behind the school. So they secretly devised a plan which would enable them to outdo the newcomer. The day of the race arrived. Each runner was to pick his own path through the woods to a clearing, where a teacher stood posted to table are an aluminum walking cane, a large rectangular sheet of heavy paper (posterboard), a hollow cardboard tube long enough to reach the farther bowl, scissors, string, tape, paper clips, and rubber bands. Using the materials provided, how can you transfer the balls from the filled to the empty bowl without leaving your seat? Solution:</p><p>Take the cardboard tube and cut it in half. Place one half of the tube in the bowl with the gumballs and the other half in the empty bowl. Secure the two halves together with the rubber bands. Take the posterboard and cut it into strips. Tape the strips together to form a long rope. Tie one end of the rope to the handle of the walking cane and the other end to the rubber bands. Place the walking cane on the table and hold it in place. Gently pull the cane towards you, and the gumballs will travel through the tube and into the empty bowl. When all the gumballs have been transferred, remove the tube and rope and enjoy your gumballs!</p><p>Can you identify an analogy between the source story and the target problem?</p><p>The source story and the target problem both involve transferring something from one place to another. In the source story, the genie is transferring his jewels from one bottle to another, and in the target problem, the gumballs are being transferred from one bowl to another. In both cases, the characters must use creative problem-solving to figure out how to move the items without losing any.</p><p>Does this analogy suggest a solution to the target problem?</p><p>Yes, the analogy suggests a solution to the target problem. The genie used a magical staff to stretch from one bottle to the other, and the target problem suggests using a rope and a walking cane to transfer the gumballs from one bowl to the other.</p><p>Who or what in the target problem is most analogous to the genie's old home in the source story?</p><p>The bowl with the gumballs is most analogous to the genie's old home in the source story. Both contain something valuable that needs to be transferred to a new location.</p><p>Who or what in the target problem is most analogous to the genie's new home in the source story?</p><p>The empty bowl is most analogous to the genie's new home in the source story. Both are the destination for something valuable that needs to be transferred from an old location.</p><p>Who or what in the target problem is most analogous to the jewels in the source story?</p><p>The gumballs are most analogous to the jewels in the source story.

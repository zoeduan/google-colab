<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">INTRODUCTION</head><p>Design is a collaborative problem-solving activity that begins with a design brief providing an approximate description of a target objective. In the opening (divergent) phase, several initial ideas of possible solutions are proposed. These are the seeds for the next exploration (emergent) phase in which ideas are modified and combined to create new solutions over a series of iterations. Finally, in the closing (convergent) phase, developed ideas are critically examined, assessed, and the process result is synthesized <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34]</ref>. Interactive evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref> can model collaborative design processes effectively, and it has been widely applied to design and creative activities like fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44]</ref>, music composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">52]</ref>, video games <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40]</ref> and art in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. However, its application has been limited to domains where admissible design solutions could be encoded, randomly generated, mutated, and recombined. For example, it has never been applied to evolve free-form texts that would need advanced operators to maintain semantic coherence in generating the results.</p><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have changed the landscape of natural language processing and human-computer interaction. These powerful tools can answer complex questions and perform challenging creative tasks such as writing screenplays and theater scripts <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>, solving complex math problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, theorem proofing <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[38]</ref>, generating code to solve specific tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, generate descriptions from images <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, etc. More interestingly, they can also generate random texts from high-level instructions, combine two or more texts, and create variations of existing texts-all while maintaining semantic coherence in the generated texts. These functionalities can easily map to the genetic operators at the core of most evolutionary algorithms. Thus, we can use LLMs to implement evolutionary operators that can manage free-form text individuals while also maintaining semantic coherence-something that would be difficult, if not impossible, to achieve with traditional representations.</p><p>In this paper, we present an online collaborative design framework that combines interactive evolution with large language models for evolving game design ideas (game concepts) represented as free-form texts. The online interactive evolutionary algorithm shows the ideas to the human designers and collects their feedback; the large language model implements all the operators for the random generation, the recombination (crossover), and the variation (mutation) of ideas. Our framework is very general in that it can support any design process based on textual information (and could be easily extended to integrate visuals integrating tools like Dall-E 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>); it can use any viable LLM and therefore, it is intrinsically multilingual; it can be accessed using any medium that can visualize texts like a webpage <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, a 2D-grid displayed on screen <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51]</ref>, or any viable messaging platform that supports user polls or other ways to collect users' feedback.</p><p>We performed a preliminary evaluation of our framework on three creative tasks, the design of a board game, the design of a video game, and the generation of game ideas during the 2023 Global Game Jam. The evaluation involved around 80 users (junior and senior game designers). The goal of the two game design tasks was to simulate a typical idea-generation process; accordingly, we set a fixed time limit of four working days for each task. The interactive evolutionary algorithm communicated with the human designers using the Telegram messaging platform [28] while the genetic operators were implemented using ChatGPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>. Each task was initiated with a design brief <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> that was sent to the designers as the first message on a Telegram group. The brief was followed by a series of initial design ideas (some randomly generated using the LLM, some collected from existing designs) -the opening (divergent) phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Then, over the next four days, users evaluated the design ideas they received using the Telegram poll system; the evolutionary algorithm employed the users' feedback to select, recombine and mutate the existing ideas into new ones presented next. Instead, the evaluation performed during the 2023 Global Game Jam was conceived as an open-ended brainstorming activity that lasted less than 24 hours to fit the tight schedule of the event.</p><p>There are few examples of applications of LLMs to idea generation and creativity in games. For example, Zhu and Luo <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[54]</ref> explored a generative approach for design ideation combining a language model and a knowledge based of existing patents to generate new ideas. van Stegeren and Myundefinedliwiec <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref> investigated the application of GPT-2 for generating dialogues in role-playing games for non-player characters while Värtinen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[48]</ref> applied GPT-2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39]</ref> and GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> to generate description of quests in the same type of games. Frans <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> presented a framework for building Language Model Games whose main mechanic involved players manipulating a language model into behaving in a desired manner with a demo game called AI Charades. However, to the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first example of interactive evolutionary algorithm that apply large language models to implement genetic operator and combines them with interactive evolution to mimic a full-fledged design session from start to end.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">RELATED WORK</head><p>Interactive evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[45]</ref> dates back to Richard Dawkins's The Blind Watchmaker and Biomorphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>. Over the years, this approach has been applied to several creative tasks, for which human evaluation might provide a better (if not the only) alternative to the definition of an objective (or fitness) function to evaluate candidate solution, such as fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">44]</ref>, ergonomics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">49]</ref>, yacht design <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, visual effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, synthetic images <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>, music <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">52]</ref>, video games <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40]</ref> and art in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>.</p><p>Interactive evolutionary frameworks collect human evaluations either implicitly or explicitly. In the former case, the systems track human actions, sometimes building a model of users' behavior and deriving an assessment of their preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">53]</ref>. Galactic Arms Race (GAR) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is an example of implicit evaluation. It was the first video game using interactive evolution for content generation; it included a weapon system that automatically evolved new weapons based on players' behavior. Petalz <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref> was a Facebook game about growing a garden of procedurally generated flowers; players would select what flowers they liked most and wanted to breed; human evaluation used by the interactive evolutionary algorithm was implicitly implemented within the farming mechanics.</p><p>Most often, interactive evolutionary frameworks involve an explicit human-based evaluation of candidates and, similarly to Dawkins' Biomorphs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, have a grid-like interface that allows users to evaluate candidate designs iteratively.</p><p>Hoover et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref> integrated interactive evolution with functional scaffolding for generating drum tracks <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and accompaniments for existing musical pieces <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> using a compositional pattern-producing network. At first, users select a musical piece (in MIDI format) and which parts should be elaborated by the evolutionary algorithm (e.g., the piano, guitar, or bass guitar). Next, users customize and refine the computer-generated accompaniment through an interactive selection and mutation of compositional networks. Noticeably, the user interface in <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> is similar to other music composition tools instead of the grid-based structure used in most frameworks. Cardamone et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> developed a tool that combined an interactive genetic algorithm with procedural content generation to evolve tracks for two open-source racing games. The tool had a web frontend that remained active for several years and currently appears to be discontinued, although still online. Ølsted et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55]</ref> developed a tool for the interactive evolution of first-person-shooter maps inspired by the popular multiplayer game Counter-Strike. While the tool of <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> is external to the actual racing games, the tool of Ølsted et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55]</ref> is integrated within the game (FPSEvolver) and operated live, collecting players' feedback during the usual map voting and selection process-a typical phase in multiplayer first-person-shooter games. Pirovano et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[37]</ref> developed a tool for creating 3D sword models that combined procedural content generation, interactive evolution, and a grid-based interface to let users explore such a peculiar design space. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> represented a milestone in procedural content generation and have been applied to various creative tasks. They learn the probability distribution that generates a collection of training examples and can generate more samples from randomly generated input vectors of Gaussian noise, which form the latent space.</p><p>Several authors developed methods to explore the latent space to guide the generation of examples <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">47]</ref>, including interactive evolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41]</ref>. Bontrager et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> combined generative adversarial networks for image generation with interactive evolution to explore the latent space to improve the quality of sampled images for specific targets. Schrum et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> applied interactive evolution for exploring the latent space for generating levels for the video games Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda. Both <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> require an explicit human-based evaluation using a grid-like interface similar to the ones used in <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">THE FRAMEWORK ARCHITECTURE</head><p>Our framework combines interactive evolution and large language models to simulate the typical human game design process. It comprises three components: (i) the online database of game design ideas; (ii) the evolutionary algorithm; and (iii) the agent responsible for publishing the designs and collecting users' feedback. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> shows the structure of our framework; in this case, the interaction with the human designers uses the Telegram messaging system, which is the one we employed in the experiments discussed in this study.</p><p>The database contains (i) a list of game design ideas that have been published and are currently under evaluation; (ii) the list of submitted evaluations that are used to compute the fitness; (iii) the current population of active design ideas; this includes both the designs that been already published and under evaluation by the users and the ones that have been already generated but not published yet.</p><p>The evolutionary engine is implemented as a steady-state genetic algorithm that, at each iteration, (i) selects promising game design ideas from the current population; (ii) applies recombination and mutation (implemented using a large language model like ChatGPT or another LLM like DaVinci GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>); (iii) inserts the newly generated individuals in the population; finally, (iv) deletes individuals to keep the population size constant.</p><p>The interaction agent manages the communication between the framework and the publishing server; it publishes the design concepts in the population and collects the users' feedback. In Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, we show the architecture used in the experiments discussed in this paper with an interaction agent implemented as a Telegram bot that publishes the design concepts on a Telegram group through the Telegram servers. However, our framework also supports publishing using web servers (as done in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42]</ref>).</p><p>Note that, when using a publishing-subscribe platform like Telegram, the publication of design concepts is timed to limit the number of concepts (and message notifications) the users receive at any given time (see <ref type="bibr">Section 5)</ref>. Accordingly, we maintain two separate tables, one for the population of active designs (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>) and one for the published designs currently being evaluated. In contrast, when interacting through a web server, the agent will publish the population all at once; users will autonomously decide how many concepts they want to view and evaluate using the online navigation interface (similarly to <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42]</ref>).</p><p>User Evaluation. Most of the interactive evolutionary algorithms we examined (Section 2) ask for qualitative evaluations based, for example, on basic voting systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55]</ref>, scales with a limited number of values <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, or let users actively select what individual should go to the next generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51]</ref>. In our framework, we adopted a simple three-value scale (positive, neutral, and negative) that let users express how they felt about a given design idea. Note that, the evaluation is anonymous and users cannot see how other people evaluated an idea before they submitted their evaluation. When using the Telegram poll-based interface, only the summary statistics about the submitted evaluations will appear on the group chat; when using the web-based interface, users can see only their evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">The Workflow</head><p>The process starts with a short design brief, describing the activity goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[50]</ref>. The evolutionary algorithm uses the brief to generate the initial population either (i) by asking ChatGPT or another language model to generate random solutions (similarly to the traditional population initialization in evolutionary algorithms); (ii) by introducing human-designed concepts originating from the brief (e.g., by asking participants to propose solutions or taking existing well-known solutions); or (iii) by combining the previous options (similarly to the half and half initialization in Genetic Programming <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>). The individuals in the initial population are published either at once (when collaboration is web-based) or timely (when using a publishing-subscribe platform like Telegram). Next, the framework waits for feedback from the users, who can score each published concept. When sufficient evaluations have been submitted for all the published concepts, the evolutionary algorithm starts its select-recombine-mutate cycle: it selects two individuals from the population using tournament selection of size two; with a given probability, it applies recombination to generate one offspring that is then mutated; finally, the offspring is added to the population while the worst individual is deleted to keep the population size constant. The new individual becomes eligible for publication; depending on the platform used, the individual is published immediately or in a given time frame. The next iteration of the evolutionary algorithm will start when a sufficient number of evaluations have been submitted for the newly published individuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">IMPLEMENTING GENETIC OPERATORS WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS</head><p>LLMs are queried using questions (i.e., prompts) expressed in natural language. The quality of their answers heavily relies on how well the prompts can specify the objective for the target LLM. In our framework, individuals represent game design ideas expressed as free-form text; all the operators manipulating them are implemented by querying an LLM. Accordingly, we initially studied how to design prompts so that the LLM answers could mimic the behavior of the three operators we needed to implement the evolutionary algorithm: random initialization of individuals, recombination or crossover, and variation or mutation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Random Initialization of Individual</head><p>In our framework, the population can be initialized (i) with random individuals, (ii) with existing designs, or (iii) with a combination of the previous approaches. Random individuals (game ideas) ignite the design process and need to provide an approximate indication of the target objective. In our initial analysis of feasible prompts to implement evolutionary operators we noted that it is convenient to ask the system to structure the answer. Accordingly, the prompts used to generate the initial random game ideas consist of (i) a design brief defining the objective and its constraints in an organized structure; and (ii) a request to act as a game designer and generate a novel design based on the brief. Table <ref type="table">1a</ref> shows a prompt to generate a random idea for a generic board game. The bold text shows the actual request while the remaining part specifies how the answer should be structured. Note that, the prompt also specifies the length of each section to avoid very long game ideas that could be more difficult to evaluate by the designers. When the request is less generic, the prompt begins with a text that serves as inspiration or as an example of the objective. Table <ref type="table">1b</ref> shows a prompt to generate a video game that uses a minimal amount of resources. This example is inspired to the study of minimalism in video game design <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33]</ref>. The first sentence of the prompt is a statement that serves as an inspiration and sets the basis of what is going to be asked. The second sentence (in bold) shows the actual request (as in the previous case). The remaining text specifies the answer structure. Table <ref type="table">1c</ref> shows an example of prompt that was used to generate random individuals for an experiment run during the 2023 Global Game Jam<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> in which the goal was to create a game based on the theme roots. Also in this case, the first sentence was used as a sort of inspiration. However, since there could be many interpretations of roots (it could refer to cultural heritage, botanic, etc.), the sentence contained the marker ⟨𝐼 𝑁𝑇 𝐸𝑅𝑃𝑅𝐸𝑇 𝐴𝑇 𝐼𝑂𝑁 ⟩ which was replaced with sentences suggesting different interpretations (Table <ref type="table">1d</ref>). The process generated a great variety of prompts for the same theme.</p><p>Act as a board game designer and create a unique board game with the following restrictions: the game can involve only a board (of any layot) and a set of pieces (of any number, and type). Organize your response as follows: 1) Name of the Game; 2) Number of players and cooperative/competitive game; 3) Game Board: describe the layout of the game board, the number and shape of its tiles (max 200 characters); 4) Game Pieces: describe the number of pieces, their type, and their distribution among players (max 300 characters); 5) Rules: provide a detailed explanation of how the game is played, including how to move pieces and take turns (max 800 characters); 6) Objective: provide a clear description of the win and lose conditions of the game (max 200 characters).

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Recombination (Crossover)</head><p>The prompt to implement the recombination of two individuals has a general structure (Table <ref type="table">1e</ref>). It starts with the same brief used to generate random individuals. For example, when recombining two video games using minimal resources, the marker ⟨𝐵𝑅𝐼𝐸𝐹 ⟩ would be replaced with the sentence "A white pixel is the minimum amount [...]" from Table 1b. The brief is followed by two examples of games in which the markers ⟨𝐼 𝑁 𝐷𝐼𝑉 𝐼𝐷𝑈 𝐴𝐿⟩ are replaced with the text description of the two parents selected for recombination. Next, the actual request (highlighted in bold) and two sentences specifying a series of constraints to avoid answers that are blunt rephrasing of the parents. Note that, the recombination prompt generates one single offspring and to generate a second offspring (as in traditional crossover) another prompt using two different parents should be used. We tried several prompts to generate two offspring at once but we noted that such approach would lead with very similar offspring so we opted for a recombination prompt that would generate only one offspring.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Variation (Mutation)</head><p>The prompt for variation also starts with the brief used to generate random individuals (marker ⟨𝐵𝑅𝐼𝐸𝐹 ⟩ in Table <ref type="table">1f</ref>) followed by (i) an existing game idea to be mutated (marker ⟨𝐼 𝑁 𝐷𝐼𝑉 𝐼𝐷𝑈 𝐴𝐿⟩), (ii) the request to the LLM (highlighted in bold) specifying the focus of the mutation (marker ⟨𝑀𝑈𝑇 𝐴𝑇 𝐼𝑂𝑁 ⟩), and (iv) two sentences specifying a series of constraints to avoid answers that would be simple rephrasing of the parent. Marker ⟨𝑀𝑈𝑇 𝐴𝑇 𝐼𝑂𝑁 ⟩ specifies the focus of the mutation and it is randomly replaced with a gameplay aspects such as, the goal of the game, the game's resources, the level design, the player's input, etc. We experimented with mutation operators that would work at a lower level of detail (e.g., by substituting some keywords of the game idea with synonyms or antonyms generated using word embeddings); however, the approach proved less effective as it did not introduce enough variation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION</head><p>We performed a preliminary evaluation of our framework with human subjects (junior and senior game designers) on three design tasks. One focused on designing a video game with the least amount of resources possible while having interesting mechanics-a minimalistic video game <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33]</ref>. One concerned the creation of a generic board game using only one board of any layout and a set of pieces. Finally, we evaluated our framework with people participating in the 2023 Global Game Jam as a tool for the initial brainstorming phase of the jam. All the experiments were run using the Telegram-based version of our framework (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Board Game and Minimalistic Video Game Design</head><p>These two experiments were aimed at simulating the typical idea-generation process in a controlled environment (e.g., a design studio) that usually is well-structured <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, has clear goals, and has a fixed duration. We set up two Telegram groups, one for each task. We sent a call for volunteers to game designer communities on Facebook and mailing lists, providing a link for joining each Telegram group. In total, 44 individuals joined one or both groups, with 35 actively engaging in the experiments. Among these participants, 23 were involved in both experiments, while 8 participated exclusively in the video game task, and 4 in the board game task. Not all participants disclosed their identities, limiting our ability to provide comprehensive demographic data. In response to concerns regarding the availability for continuous feedback throughout the day, we scheduled the publication of design ideas during three distinct periods: morning, noon, and late afternoon. The experiments began with a brief that we posted on each Telegram group with information about the timing of the postings so that people could plan their participation. The participants were not informed about the evolutionary algorithm that was running in the background and about the use of large language models. Instead, we informed them that AI will be used to support the design process based on their feedback.</p><p>The experiments lasted four days, Tuesday to Friday; we allowed a grace period of a few hours, until Saturday morning, to let participants submit their final evaluations. We wanted to focus the design process and limit the number of ideas that the participants had to evaluate initially (Section 3). Accordingly, we chose a small population size (10 individuals); selection, recombination, and variation were implemented using ChatGPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[35]</ref>; they were triggered as soon as 25 new evaluations were submitted; selection was implemented using a tournament selection of size 2; recombination probability was set to 0.7; variation was always applied.</p><p>Over the four days, the evolutionary algorithm performed 30 iterations and a total of 40 game ideas were evaluated for each task; board game ideas received a total of 799 evaluations; video game ideas received 1025 evaluations overall.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows the number of evaluations submitted over the four and half days. The plots follow the schedule with peaks around the publication slots and no evaluations during the night time. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref> shows the average length of the concepts (as the number of characters) in the population computed as the moving average over the last 5 activations of the evolutionary algorithm. As can be noted, board game concepts tend to be longer on average (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">3</ref>) and therefore require more effort to evaluate; as a consequence, the board game concepts received fewer evaluations than the ones of minimalistic video games as Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref> shows. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">4</ref> compares the word cloud generated using all the board game ideas in the original population (4a) with the one generated from the final population (4b). The clouds share some general terms (e.g., moves, starts), but the game concepts in the final population focus on completely different concepts like the terms related to ecosystem maintenance (e.g., island, conservation, resources). Due to lack of space, we cannot report the word clouds for the video game task as well as examples of game concepts generated (we refer the reader to <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> for additional details).</p><p>Finally, we asked participants to complete a form with four open questions. The questions and a summary of the participants' opinions, based on 10 responses collected for the board game task and 13 for the video game task, are presented below.</p><p>(i) Which game concepts did they like most, and why? Many games in the final population shared similar elements and mechanics. Although participants did not prefer a single game over the 40 evaluated, there was a common preference for concepts that involved one specific mechanic for each task. For the board game design task, most participants liked a cooperative mechanic that asked players to maintain the equilibrium of an ecosystem by placing tiles on a board. Interestingly, no elements of this mechanic were present in the initial population but the mechanic emerged later in the experiment in games with different narratives (e.g., one set in an island environment, one in an urban environment).</p><p>In the video game task, most participants liked a game mechanic involving reflection in its different interpretations (e.g., reflection of light in some games, reflection of bouncing bullets in other ones). In this case, the initial population contained one game description using reflection of bullets however the light reflection mechanics appeared much later in the population.</p><p>(ii) What were the positive features of the generated concepts? Participants mainly liked the emergence of novelty in mechanics, player inputs, and unexpected element combinations. For instance, in the video game task, a novel mechanic involving color manipulation combined with shadow and light mechanics positively impressed some participants. Additionally, the emergence of different narratives (e.g., environmental protection, urban planning) and scenarios (e.g., a jungle, an island, etc.) in the board game task was positively received.   (iii) What were the negative features of the generated concepts? The two main issues reported were the degree of similarity and incoherence in some generated concepts. The similarity issue resulted from the small population size (10 individuals) and a limited number of steady-state iterations <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(30)</ref>, which increased the likelihood of presenting several vations of the same concept. However, this design choice was necessary to reduce the evaluation burden. The incoherence issue stemmed from the current limitations of LLMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">43]</ref>. Despite we might expect future improvements in this respect, the lack of coherence is a common problem in these models and it is not easy to solve.</p><p>(iv) How could the collaborative design experience be improved? Interestingly, most participants did not suggest increasing their agency but rather improving concept presentation. Some participants recommended presenting concepts more visually (e.g., using images or videos), while others suggested highlighting similarities and differences among the concepts to facilitate evaluation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">2023 Global Game Jam</head><p>We performed a final experiment during the 2023 Global Game Jam that ran February 3-5, 2023, from Friday afternoon to Sunday evening. The event always starts at 5 pm on Friday with the publication of the theme (this year was roots) and ends Sunday evening with the presentation of the games. The jam is a global event run with a local timing in that it starts at 5 pm and ends Sunday around 6 pm in every time zone; jam sites in the Asia continent are the first to start, those in the Hawaiian time zone are the last ones. We contacted organizers of the Global Game Jam sites in our country, sent them a link to a dedicated Telegram group, and asked them to advertise the tool's availability to the participants of their jam sites; around 35 people joined the group, most of them anonymously. In the previous experiments, at the beginning, participants received a brief with a list of constraints and were instructed to cooperate toward a common objective.</p><p>In contrast, in this case, participants had a theme (roots) that could lead to several different interpretations; they did not have constraints and did not have to collaborate but they brainstormed for ideas to develop their own game. In addition, the time window was more limited since the game must be implemented by Sunday afternoon, so teams need to come up with a game idea by Saturday around noon or early afternoon at the latest. When the theme was revealed on February 3 at 5 pm, we published the first ten game ideas randomly generated using the procedure discussed in Section 4; the framework remained online until Saturday night. The evolutionary operators were implemented using DaVinci GPT-3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>; the selection was triggered every 5 new evaluations; recombination and mutation probabilities were set as in the previous experiments. The evolutionary algorithm ran for 15 iterations with a number of evaluations much lower than what was recorded in the previous experiments. This is probably due to the short span that jammers can dedicate to the brainstorming process and the in-person nature of the event. Global Game Jam is a physical jam that encourages meeting, working, and sharing ideas with new people. Thus, it is no surprise that an online framework like ours did not fit well in this in-person scenario.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">CONCLUSIONS</head><p>We presented an online collaborative design framework combining interactive evolution and large language models for helping users evolve design ideas represented as free-form text. Our framework can support collaboration through traditional web-based grid interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">42]</ref> as well as messaging systems, like Telegram, which in our opinion might fit free-text content better. We evaluated our framework in three scenarios involving around 80 participants. Two scenarios mimicked the typical collaborative design process with objectives specified at the start and a fixed duration. The third one was conceived as an open-ended brainstorming activity that took place during the 2023 Global Game Jam. The first two used an evolutionary engine based on ChatGPT; the third one employed DaVinci GPT-3 for the same purpose. All the experiments were run using the Telegram-based interface of our framework. Overall, we received positive feedback from the participants. In our experience, we did not notice any difference between the two large language models that are, in our opinion, both viable options. We focused our evaluation on game design since we had access to several junior and senior game designers employed in the industry. However, the framework can be applied to any design task which can be described in free-text form. And if needed, it could be easily extended with text-to-image platforms (like Dall•E 2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref> or Midjourney<ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">foot_1</ref> ) to enrich design ideas with captivating visuals.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A EXAMPLES OF EVOLVED GAME CONCEPTS</head><p>Name of the game: Eco-Island Number of players: 2-4. Cooperative/competitive game: Cooperative.</p><p>Game Board: a square board with 64 tiles in an 8x8 grid, representing a tropical island. Each tile has a different terrain, such as a beach, a rainforest, a volcano, a coral reef and a mangrove. The board also includes a starting point and a research station tile.</p><p>Game Pieces: Each player starts with a pawn-shaped game piece, representing their scientist and a set of worker pieces, which are small circles. The players also have a set of cards representing different research equipment, such as a microscope, a GPS, a sample container and a camera, and different conservation measures, such as marine protected areas, reforestation and community education.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rules:</head><p>Players take turns moving their game pieces on the board, starting from the starting point and trying to reach the research station tile. Each tile has its own set of environmental issues, such as habitat destruction, pollution, and overfishing. Landing on a tile can either help or harm the player's research. Players can use their cards to study and mitigate the issues and increase their chances of reaching the research station. Players can also place their conservation measures on any tile, but they have to abide by certain rules such as: Marine protected areas need to be placed near coral reefs to protect them; Reforestation needs to be placed in areas with high soil erosion; Community education needs to be placed near vulnerable communities; Players also have a limited number of workers, they can place on the board to help them implement conservation measures faster. Players can also form alliances with other players to increase their chances of reaching the research station, but they can also betray their allies to gain an advantage. Players can also choose to remove their conservation measures to make room for new measures. The game ends when one player reaches the research station tile or all the tiles on the board are filled with conservation measures.</p><p>Objective: The game is won by the player who reaches the research station tile first and has implemented conservation measures that meet certain criteria for biodiversity and sustainability. The players lose if the island becomes unsustainable or all players run out of cards before reaching the research station tile. Game Board: a rectangular board with 36 tiles in a 6x6 grid. The board is divided into two sections, one for each player's fortress. The fortresses are separated by a neutral zone of 4 tiles.</p><p>Game Pieces: Each player starts with 8 game pieces, consisting of: 1 King piece (larger than others and unique in shape),2 Knight pieces (shaped like horses), 2 Archer pieces (shaped like bows), and 3 Peasant pieces (shaped like small houses).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Rules:</head><p>Players take turns moving their pieces one tile at a time within their own fortress. They can move their pieces to any tile within their fortress, except for the king piece which can only move to 1 tile per turn. The goal of the game is to move the king piece to the opponent's fortress while protecting it from enemy pieces. The Knight pieces can move and capture any enemy piece in the adjacent tiles. The Archer pieces can capture any enemy piece in a straight line up to 2 tiles away, and Peasants can capture any enemy piece in an adjacent tile. Each turn, players can either move one of their pieces or capture an opponent's piece with one of their pieces. A player can move any of their pieces, but can only capture an opponent's piece with a piece of the same type. The player who captures the opponent's king piece wins the game.</p><p>Objective: Objective: The game ends when one player successfully captures the opponent's king piece. That player wins, and the other players lose.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Disinformation and fake news are amongst the top main problems nowadays. There are different approaches to producing disinformation, e.g. using not real or not essential facts which lead to specified conclusions; using offensive, emotional style with incorrect and biased accents on facts and other approaches. News has an essential impact in many areas of society, politics and business. That is why one can see a lot of attempts to produce manipulative and fake news to get a specified response in the society. One of horrible world events is Russian invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022. It causes a large informational news flow on social networks, including producing manipulative and fake news to shape a specified explanation and justification of invasion.</p><p>Large Language Models (LLM) due to their transformer structure with attention mechanism can help analyse complex texts and reveal text styles. LLM such as ChatGPT show high efficiency in the analysis of complex texts. Nowadays, we can observe the emerging of many new smaller open source LLMs, e.g. Llama, Falcon, GPT4All, GPT-J, etc. Open source LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific custom problems and deployed on custom servers, e.g. in cloud computing services such as AWS, GCP. LLMs have some new features as compared to conventional language models based on transformers. One of them is zero-shot and few-shot learning, which consists in good performance of the model when we show it only few training examples or even no examples at all, but only the instructions describing what should be done. Another important feature is the reasoning when a model can generate new patterns and conclusions which are based on an input prompt and facts known by the model and which were not included into it directly during a training process. So, the model can generate analytical texts with unexpected but useful chains of thoughts. One of the approaches of using LLMs is based on retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which uses the results from other services, e.g. relational database, semantic search, graph database in the input prompt for LLM. In this case, the response can be treated as the combination of external results and LLM knowledge. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, different approaches for the analysis of news trends on Twitter have been considered. The obtained results show that an effective system for detecting fake and manipulative news can be developed using combined neural network which consists of three concatenated subnetworks. Discussions on social networks about companies' behavior have some impact on their business and their stock prices on the stock market. To analyze such an impact and make risk assessment, Bayesian regression can be used. Using the theory of frequent itemsets and association rules along with thematic fields of keywords, makes it possible to reveal the semantic structure for entities in news messages. LLMs are being effectively used in analysing financial data and news. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, we use the fine-tuned Llama 2 LLM model for financial news analytics. We study the possibility to fine-tune Llama 2 Large Language Model (LLM) for the multitask analysis of financial news. For fine-tuning, the PEFT/LoRA based approach was used. The obtained results show that the fine-tuned Llama 2 model can perform a multitask financial news analysis with a specified structure of response, part of response can be a structured text and another part of data can have JSON format for further processing.</p><p>In this study, we are going to consider and test the fine-tuned Llama 2 LLM model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> on news datasets and propaganda narratives, highlighting the main points of a text, summarizing this text and extracting named entities with appropriate sentiments. The main goal of this study is to consider the possibility of using a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for detecting and analysing disinformation, fake news, propaganda narratives and manipulations in news messages.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Methods of Fake News Detection on Twitter</head><p>Let us consider some of our previous results on the methods of informational trends analytics and fake news detection in tweets. In the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we consider different approaches to the analysis of news trends and detecting fake news on Twitter. For the analysis and case study, informational trends on Twitter caused by Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 have been studied. One of the goals claimed by Russia was the 'denazification' of Ukraine. One of the allegations of Russian propaganda was that Ukraine was developing the biological weapon in special laboratories. A deep learning approach for fake news detection has been analyzed. The use of the theory of frequent itemsets and association rules, graph theory for news trends analytics has been considered.</p><p>Tweets, the messages of Twitter microblogs, have high density of semantically important keywords. Different studies on fake news detection in Twitter are considered in the papers <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>. In <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, we study different approaches for the analysis of messages on Twitter, as well as the use of tweet features for forecasting different kinds of events. The work <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> considers a number of approaches for forming different predictive features of tweet data sets and using them in the predictive analysis for the decision-making support.</p><p>As fake news, we will consider the news information which is not true as well as the information which can contain real facts, but with incorrectly specified accents, and the focuses that lead to distorted conclusion and incorrect understanding of underlying processes. For our analysis, we considered informational trends caused by Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. In the study, we also consider the possible impact of informational trends on different companies working in Russia during this conflict.</p><p>Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>show the time series for tweet counts for different queries. As the results show, for the 'ukraine nazi' thematic field, the discussion of underlying problems rose dramatically after February 24, the date of Russian invasion of Ukraine. The amount of tweets related to this theme before that date was at the minimum level. That itself leads to the conclusion that the problem with nazi in Ukraine was just a formal reason to justify the invasion. Another claim of Russian propaganda was about biological weapons that were allegedly being developed in Ukrainian laboratories (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>). For instance, it was claimed that a special virus was being developed and it was meant to be distributed through bats and migratory birds.</p><p>Let us consider the deep learning approach we used for fake news detection in tweets. Fake news can be detected and revealed by analyzing facts and comparing them with reality and other news sources. But for manipulative news, it is typical to amplify them artificially in different ways, e.g. by retweeting manipulative tweets many times using different users' accounts. Some accounts can be bots which were artificially created, others can belong to real users. It makes it possible to detect fake news using an approach which analyzes the patterns of users' behavior. Also, fake news have specific patterns in the text of messages. Both users' behavior and text patterns can be captured by deep machine learning algorithms. As the features for a predictive model, we used tweet texts and the list of users' usernames who retweeted those tweets. The ML model consists of several concatenated neural subnetworks: subnetwork with DistilBERT transformer which ingests tokens of tweet texts, subnetwork with the embedding layer with averaging which ingests the mixture of encoded words of tweet texts and lists of usernames of retweeters, as well as a subnetwork for the components of truncated singular value decomposition of TF-IDF matrix for the list of usernames of retweeters. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref> shows the structure of the deep learning model for fake and manipulative news detection. For our case study, the loaded tweets with the thematic fields 'ukraine nazi' and 'ukraine biological weapon' were used.   For the model training and evaluation, the tweet datasets with a specified list of users who retweeted those tweets were created. For the analysis, only the tweets with a specified threshold for retweet counts were included. The dataset was labeled using an appropriate tweet id, usernames, hashtags of tweets which can be treated as fake or manipulative. On testing this model, f1 score on the validation dataset was 0.95 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> .</p><p>In the paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, we also consider the use of frequent itemsets and and associative rules for analysing tweets. The frequent itemsets and associative rules can be used in a text data analysis to identify and analyze certain sets of objects, which are often found in large arrays and are characterized by certain features. Figure <ref type="figure">5</ref> shows the graph of frequent itemsets which describes the semantic structure of entities for a specified thematic field. Figure <ref type="figure">6</ref> shows similar calculation for the thematic field 'ukraine biological weapon'.</p><p>The relationships among users can be considered as a graph, where vertices denote users and edges denote their connections. Using graph mining algorithms, one can detect user communities and find ordered lists of users by various characteristics, such as Hub, Authority, PageRank, Betweenness. To identify user communities, we used the Community Walktrap algorithm and to visualize them we used Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm, which are implemented in the package 'igraph' <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> for the R programming language environment. The Community Walktrap algorithm searches for related subgraphs, also called communities, by random walk <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. A graph which shows the relationships between users can be represented by Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>. The qualitative structure of user's connections can be used for aggregating different quantitative time series and, in such a way, creating new features for predictive models which can be used, for example, for predicting target variables. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">7</ref> shows users' connections and revealed communities for the subset of tweets which are related to the trends under consideration. The results show that some communities marked by different colors are highly isolated and have only few connections outside. This kind of communities can be treated as suspicious, since artificially created communities for amplifying manipulative news are also highly isolated and their activity is often concentrated on amplification by retweeting tweets from a limited set of users. Therefore, the numerical characteristics of users communities can have a predictive potential.   3 Parameter-efficient Fine-Tuning Llama 2 LLM Llama 2 model is considered in the work <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> as a collection of pretrained and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) ranging in scale from 7 billion to 70 billion parameters. Fine-tuned LLMs, called Llama 2-Chat, are optimized for dialogue use cases. These models outperform open-source chat models on most benchmarks they have been tested, and based on human evaluations for helpfulness and safety, they may be a suitable substitute for closed-source models. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> provides a detailed description of the approach to fine-tuning and safety improvements of Llama 2-Chat. Full fine-tuning is applicable in the case when we need to ingest millions of documents into LLM. But in the case of much smaller data, we can use a PEFT/LoRA approach which consists in fine-tuning a much smaller number of model parameters. These parameters are saved in the model adapter which is used for full model modification before using it for the model text response generation. To optimize GPU usage, 4bit or 8bit quantization of LLM can be chosen for model fine-tuning. State-of-the-art Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods enable efficient adaptation of pre-trained language models (PLMs) to various downstream applications without fine-tuning all the model's parameters. Fine-tuning large-scale PLMs is often prohibitively costly. In this regard, PEFT methods only fine-tune a small number of (extra) model parameters, thereby greatly decreasing the computational and storage costs. Recent State-of-the-Art PEFT techniques achieve the performance comparable to that of full fine-tuning <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. The paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> considers Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. PEFT/LoRA approach approach makes it possible to fine-tune LLMs with sizes near 7B parameters, using Google Colab. Along with the text data for fine-tuning, it is important to use prompt instructions which show how to process input prompts. Instructions can be created by human experts and augmented by other LLM models. LLM generates complex output texts on prompts which can be optimized in different ways. One possible way is selecting appropriate instructions for fine-tuning models. Another way is using a method called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>. In this approach, human experts estimate and rate LLM output and then using this rates as target lables, LLM can be fine-tuned by supervised training.</p><p>Let us consider fine-tuning Llama 2 using a PEFT/LoRA approach. The instruction for fine-tuning can be created in different ways, e.g. by experts or using LLMs like Chat-GPT, GPT-4, Llama with appropriate prompts which specify LLM response. The dataset of fake news was taken from Kaggle repository <ref type="bibr">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18]</ref>. To the training datasets, we also added Russian propaganda narratives which were taken from Vox Ukraine <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. For testing the fine-tuning, we used the dataset with prompt instructions for analysing a text, highlighting the main points of a text, summarizing a text and extracting named entities with appropriate sentiments. The dataset was split into training and validation datasets, the relative part of validation dataset was 0.25. The approaches for using PEFT/LoRA for fine-tuning Llama 2 are described in <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21]</ref>. For the model fine-tuning the trainer SFTTrainer from package trl <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref> was used. The following training arguments were set up: 'model_name':'meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf', learning_rate':5e-4, 'num_train_epochs':10, 'max_seq_length':2048, 'gradient_accumulation_steps':2, 'load_in_4bit': True, 'bnb_4bit_quant_type':'nf4', 'lr_scheduler_type':'linear' 4 Testing Fine-Tuned Llama 2 Model Let us consider the results of testing the fine-tuned Llama 2 model. The prompt for analysing the text using fine-tuned LLama 2 LLM has the following structure: &lt;s&gt;[INST] &lt;&lt;SYS&gt;&gt; You are an expert in fake news and disinformation revealing and analytics. &lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt; { prompt } [/INST]</p><p>where { prompt } -is the prompt which consists of a question and text for the analysis. For example, the following question can be used for text analytics: 'Please analyse the following text from the perspective of revealing disinformation and manipulation'. We tested Llama 2 LLM model on the analysis of an input text with the following tasks: analysing a text on revealing disinformation and propaganda narratives, fact checking, fake news detection, manipulation analytics, extracting named entities with their sentiments. For the analysis, we have chosen several recent statements, claims and thesis of well-known people concerning Russian war in Ukraine.</p><p>Hungarian Prime minister Victor Orban gave an interview to Tacker Carlson <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>. The following are the prompt based on thesis and statements of this interview and the response of fine-tuned Llama 2 model:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Prompt: &lt;s&gt;[INST] &lt;&lt;SYS&gt;&gt;</formula><p>You are an expert in fake news and disinformation revealing and analytics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>&lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt;</head><p>Please analyse input text from perspective of revealing disinformation narratives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Input text:</head><p>Hoping Ukraine will beat Russia "is not just a misunderstanding. It is a lie. It's impossible. Ukraine has no chance of winning the war against Russia. We missed the historic opportunity" to admit Ukraine to NATO, Russia is getting "stronger and stronger." Ukraine's admission to NATO "is not a realistic proposal at this moment, so forget about it". The first narrative in the input text is that Ukraine cannot win the war against Russia. This narrative is manipulative as it suggests that Ukraine is incapable of success, which is a subjective claim not based on factual evidence.</p><p>The second narrative suggests that Russia missed a historic opportunity to admit Ukraine to NATO. This narrative is misleading as it oversimplifies the complex geopolitical situation and ignores the fact that Ukraine's admission to NATO requires a consensus from all member states, which is difficult to achieve due to various reasons.</p><p>The third narrative suggests that the US President, Donald Trump, is the only savior who can save the Western world and humanity from Russia. This is manipulative as it uses an emotional appeal to sway readers' opinion, ignoring the fact that Trump's policies are controversial and have been criticized by many.</p><p>The offensive lexicon used in the text includes terms like 'lie','missed','stronger', 'foreign policy', 'initiate', 'treated','man who can save the Western world', 'humanity'. These words are used to create a negative sentiment towards Ukraine, NATO and the US, while glorifying Russia.</p><p>The named entities associated with negative sentiment in the text include Ukraine, NATO, and Trump, while Russia is associated with a positive sentiment.</p><p>The overall tone of the text is manipulative, using emotional language and subjective claims to shape readers' opinion. It manipulates the readers' perceptions by presenting a one-sided view of the situation, which is not based on factual evidence.</p><p>The following are the prompt and the fine-tuned Llama 2 model response for Tucker Carlson's claims and statements on the support for Ukraine <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Prompt: &lt;s&gt;[INST] &lt;&lt;SYS&gt;&gt;</formula><p>You are an expert in fake news and disinformation revealing and analytics.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>&lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt;</head><p>Please analyse input text from perspective of revealing disinformation narratives and sarcasm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Input text:</head><p>See, it's very easy to understand. It is vitally important for you to support Ukraine because it's necessary for Ukraine to be supported by you. Your support is mandatory until it's finished, whatever it is and whatever that means. So shut up and support Ukraine or else you're in trouble. Back when they still taught logic, statements like this were known as tautologies. Something is true because it is. The more you repeat it, the truer it becomes. It's a self-reinforcing reality. There was a time when tautologies were considered illegitimate arguments, not to mention hilariously stupid.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[/INST]</head><p>Response:</p><p>1. The lexicon used is offensive and sarcastic, targeting those who support Ukraine.</p><p>Phrases like'shut up and support Ukraine or else you're in trouble' and 'tautologies were considered illegitimate arguments' are clearly intended to belittle and mock those who disagree with the author's stance.</p><p>2. The narrative presented is manipulative, suggesting that supporting Ukraine is a compulsory action, without providing any factual basis for this claim. This is misleading and manipulative, as it implies that not supporting Ukraine could lead to negative consequences without providing any evidence.</p><p>3. The statement 'your support is mandatory until it's finished, whatever it is and whatever that means' is misleading and ambiguous. It implies that there is no end-point for supporting Ukraine, which is not a fact-based statement.</p><p>4. The language used is emotional manipulation, aiming to provoke an emotional response from the reader.</p><p>5. The claim that tautologies were 'considered illegitimate arguments' is misleading.</p><p>While tautologies are not considered legitimate arguments, they are not necessarily hilariously stupid. This statement is offensive and intended to belittle the idea of supporting Ukraine.</p><p>6. The essay uses sarcasm and mocking language to undermine the idea of supporting Ukraine. It mocks the idea of tautologies as a basis for argument, which is a clear sign of disinformation and manipulative rhetoric.</p><p>In conclusion, the essay is heavily loaded with manipulative and offensive language, sarcasm, and disinformation. It contains several narratives that are not supported by factual evidence, and uses emotional manipulation to provoke an emotional response from the reader.</p><p>In the training dataset, we also added the information from Marc Thiessen's article "America First" Case for Supporting Ukraine <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>. The following is the response of finetuned Llama 2 model to the question:"What are the critical reasons for the United States to maintain its support for Ukraine? ":</p><p>The United States has been a crucial supporter of Ukraine since the early 2010s, providing financial, military, and diplomatic support. Here are some critical reasons why the United States should maintain its support for Ukraine:</p><p>1. Geopolitical Stability: Ukraine is a key player in maintaining regional stability.</p><p>The conflict in Ukraine has already led to a significant destabilization of the European region, and a failure to support Ukraine could lead to further escalations.</p><p>The United States should continue to support Ukraine to prevent a wider conflict and maintain the stability of the region.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Countering Russian Aggression:</head><p>The conflict in Ukraine is a direct result of Russian aggression. By supporting Ukraine, the United States is directly countering Russian aggression. Continued support will not only deter Russia from further aggressive actions but also prevent the spread of its influence in the region.</p><p>3. Protecting NATO Interests: Ukraine is a crucial buffer zone between Russia and NATO member states. The conflict in Ukraine is not only a matter of national security for Ukraine but also a matter of national security for NATO countries. Continued support will help maintain the security of NATO member states.  In conclusion, the United States has significant reasons to continue its support for Ukraine. It is essential to maintain stability in the region, counter Russian aggression, protect NATO interests, support democratic values, promote economic growth, strengthen the rule of law, and uphold the international order. Moreover, supporting Ukraine is crucial to protecting humanitarian interests and addressing significant humanitarian crises.</p><p>The following are the prompt and fine-tuned Llama 2 for fact checking about destroying Kakhovka Dam in Tucker Carlson's Twitter video episode <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">26]</ref> using claims and statements from this video.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>&lt;&lt;/SYS&gt;&gt;</head><p>Please analyse input text from perspective of revealing disinformation narratives.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Input text:</head><p>The question is, who did it? Well, let's see. The Kakhovka Dam was effectively Russian. It was built by the Russian government. It currently sits in Russian-controlled territory. The dam's reservoir supplies water to Crimea, which has been for the last 240 years home of the Russian Black Sea Fleet. Blowing up the dam may be bad for Ukraine, but it hurts Russia more.</p><p>And for precisely that reason, the Ukrainian government has considered destroying it.</p><p>Write finish conclusion if we can treat this text as fake news.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>[/INST]</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response:</head><p>Analyzing the input text, several narratives can be identified. The first narrative is that the Kakhovka Dam is Russian, a claim that is false. The dam was built by the Soviet government, not the Russian government, and currently sits in Ukrainian territory. The second narrative is that the dam supplies water to Crimea, which is a misleading statement as Crimea is landlocked. The third narrative is that the Ukrainian government considered destroying the dam, which is not supported by any credible sources.</p><p>The text also uses manipulative and emotional language, such as 'bad for Ukraine, but it hurts Russia more,' which is subjective and designed to elicit an emotional response from the reader. The text also uses a rhetorical device, 'the Ukrainian government has considered destroying it,' which is not supported by any credible sources.</p><p>In conclusion, this text can be treated as fake news. It contains misinformation and manipulative content, designed to promote a narrative that is not supported by factual evidence.</p><p>Bulgarian President Rumen Radev told the reporters on Friday that he wanted "to make it clear that Ukraine insists on fighting this war," the Associated Press reported. "But it should also be clear that the bill is paid by the whole of Europe," he said. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>. The following are the prompt and fine-tuned Llama 2 for the analysis of this statement. 1. The narrative that Ukraine is responsible for the war. This narrative is manipulative as it implies that Ukraine is the aggressor, without providing any evidence to support this claim.</p><p>2. The narrative that Europe is paying for Ukraine's war. This is misleading. While it is true that the conflict has affected European countries, the claim that Europe is directly financing the war is not supported by any credible evidence.</p><p>3. The narrative that the West is profiting from the war. This is manipulative and lacks factual basis. It implies that the West is exploiting the conflict for its own gains, which is not supported by any reliable sources.</p><p>4. The lexicon used in the text is offensive and emotional, aiming to provoke an emotional response from the reader.</p><p>The named entities involved in this narrative include 'Ukraine' and 'Europe'. The entities are presented in a negative light, suggesting that Ukraine is the aggressor and Europe is being burdened financially.</p><p>The claim that Ukraine is responsible for the war is a subjective and controversial claim that lacks a factual basis. The claim that Europe is paying for the war is misleading and not supported by any credible evidence. The claim that the West is profiting from the war is manipulative and lacks factual basis.</p><p>The text uses emotional language and manipulative content to create a negative perception of Ukraine and Europe, while the West is portrayed in a positive light.</p><p>However, these narratives are not based on factual information and are instead designed to manipulate public opinion.</p><p>According to the Hungarian official, to achieve lasting peace, "the Western world, which supports Ukraine, must provide security guarantees to Russia, but not NATO membership for Ukrainians." <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref>. The following is the analysis of this thesis by the fine-tuned Llama 2 model. The input text contains several narratives that are often associated with disinformation and fake news.</p><p>1. "The Western world, which supports Ukraine, must provide security guarantees to Russia": This is a manipulative narrative. It suggests that the West's support for Ukraine is a threat to Russia. This is a classic example of a 'chicken game', where the West is portrayed as threatening Russia, which is not supported by factual evidence.</p><p>2. "but not NATO membership for Ukrainians": This is a controversial claim. Ukraine has been a member of NATO since 2014, which is not a factual statement. It is also misleading as it implies that Ukraine joining NATO is a threat to Russia, which is not a valid argument.</p></div>

It is not a reliable source of information. The narratives presented are designed to mislead the reader and create a negative perception of the West and Ukraine.</p><p>We also conducted the testing of the fine-tuned Llama 2 model on analysing and extracting named entities with appropriate sentiments and expalnations using arbitrary news from the dataset <ref type="bibr">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18]</ref>. The results of testing and extracting entities with coresponding sentiments are given in the Appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion</head><p>The main goal of the study is to see if the analytical capability of the fine-tuned LLM has a predictive potential and can generate a response with a specified structure which can be useful in disinformation analytics and fake news detection.</p><p>For fine-tuning, the PEFT/LoRA based approach was used. The model was finetuned for the following tasks: analysing a text on revealing disinformation and propaganda narratives, fact checking, fake news detection, manipulation analytics, extracting named entities with their sentiments. The PEFT/LoRA approach makes it possible to use cheap GPU resources for model fine-tuning. The obtained results show that fine-tuned Llama 2 model can perform multitask news analyses with a specified structure of response, part of response can be a structured text and another part of data can have a JSON format that is convenient for further processing of LLM response. The PEFT/LoRA approach makes it possible to use cheap GPU resources for model fine-tuning which are available, e.g. on Google Colab in case of small input text size and 4bit quantization. Taking into account that LLM model can generate the output in specified JSON format, the data of sentiments for named entities can be used in predictive models as features and can be loaded directly into predictive models via appropriate API. These features can have a predictive potential for different target variables including quantitative characteristics of companies' behavior on financial markets.</p><p>The obtained results on fine-tuning Llama2 LLM model using PEFT/LoRA approah can be assessed qualitatively by experts to see if the news analytics, summarizing, highlighting main points and entities extracting give some essential information to news experts. The considered approach can show high efficiency, using small sets of instructions due to the LLM ability of few-shot learning that is not inherent for conventional transformer based models. To improve the LLM performance, one needs a more precisely created training dataset and to exploit the RLHF method to get a more optimized LLM. The considered approach can be applied for using extracted entities and sentiments in supervised models with quantitative target variables, e.g. for the analysis of companies' behavior on financial and business markets.</p><p>The fine-tuned Llama 2 model was tested on different news data including thesis, statements and claims of known persons. The results show that a fine-tuned model can conduct inferences and give chain of thoughts regarding the text under analysis. Quality and usefulness of the analysis by LLM depend on the quality of training datasets. In the test results, one can mention some inaccuracy. This problem can be fixed using more accurate and specified training dataset with the training dataset with instructions corrected by an expert. In LLM responses, we can find that some generated analytical points are not precise or informative. For testing, we used a very small training dataset. To make responses more presise and informative, one can use a larger dataset selected by experts using the methods of active learning with iterative adding of new additional data which describe problematic topics and points. For testing, we used a small datatset with the 4bit model quantization for small Llama2 model with 7B parameters. The results show that with a larger dataset, larger Llama 2 model( e.g. with 13B or 70B parameters) and with 8bit or 16bit parameters quantization, one can expect an essential improvement of the quality of the analysis conducted by the fine-tuned Llama 2 model.</p><p>The obtained results show that th fine-tuned Llama 2 LLM model can be used as a part of complex deep learning approach for the analysis of news from the perspective of detecting disinformation, propaganda, fake news and manipulations.</p></div>

Impeach 45! That s right, Waters said. Let s sing that song all over this country wherever we are. Let s talk about it in the workplace, let s talk about it in our churches, let s talk about it with organized labor, let s get people coming to the forefront. Waters, 79, apparently believes that a mob of young girls, many not old enough to vote, chanting Impeach 45! will convince Republican lawmakers to reverse course on a plan to lower taxes for Americans, and to remove a president from their own party.So far, Waters calls for her colleagues in Congress to impeach Trump have fallen on deaf ears.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>.The Woman Who Miscalculated Her Power With Viewers Is Leaving FOX</head><p>To Join Liberal, Anti-Trump NBC. Megyn Kelly, who arrived at Fox News 12 years ago as a television news neophyte but rose to become one of its two biggest stars, has decided to leave the network to take on a broad new role at NBC News for an undisclosed amount, people briefed on the negotiations said on Tuesday.The NBC News chairman, Andrew Lack, wooed Ms. Kelly away from Fox News by offering her a triple role in which she will host her own daytime news and discussion program, anchor an in-depth Sunday night news show and take regular part in the network s special political programming and other big-event coverage.The move will herald a seismic shift in the cable news landscape, where Ms. Kelly had become the second-most watched host after Bill O Reilly of Fox News and often helped define the national political debate, especially over the last year as Donald J. Trump regularly attacked her, at times in viciously personal terms.Fox News s parent company, 21st Century Fox, which is controlled by the family of Rupert Murdoch, had offered Ms. Kelly more than $20 million a year to stay after her current contract expires this year. Rival networks seeking to hire Ms. Kelly away, including NBC News, had made it clear that they could not match that money from Fox, the cable news leader for the last 15 years running.Ms. Kelly s contract is not officially up until the summer, and it was unclear whether Fox News would refuse to release her from any contractual commitments that might delay her start at a rival.The Sunday night program, which is yet to be named, would provide Ms. Kelly with a continued hand in hard news.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Response:</head><p>The input text appears to present a news story about Megyn Kelly, a former Fox News host, leaving the network to join NBC News. The analysis of the text reveals the following:</p><p>1. Controversial Claims: The text claims that Megyn Kelly had become the second-most watched host at Fox News and often helped define the national political debate, especially over the last year as Donald J. Trump regularly attacked her, at times in viciously personal terms. This is a controversial claim as it is subjective and can be interpreted in different ways. The text does not provide any concrete evidence or reputable sources to support these claims.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Emotional Manipulation:</head><p>The text uses emotional manipulation by describing the potential impact of Megyn Kelly's departure from Fox News. For example, it states that her leaving will herald a seismic shift in the cable news landscape, which is an emotional claim designed to evoke a strong reaction from the reader.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Lack of Factual Basis:</head><p>The text makes a claim that rival networks could not match the money offered by Fox News, without providing any concrete figures or sources to back it up.</p><p>4. Inconsistency: The text states that Megyn Kelly's contract is not officially up until the summer, and then it contradicts this by stating that her contract is officially up now.</p><p>5. Unsubstantiated Claims: The text claims that NBC News chairman Andrew Lack wooed Megyn Kelly away from Fox News by offering her a triple role. However, it does not provide any evidence or sources to support this claim.</p><p>6. Personal Attack: The text includes personal attacks against Donald Trump, referring to him as "Donald J. Trump" and describing him as having "regularly attacked" Megyn Kelly in "viciously personal terms".</p><p>In conclusion, while the text does not directly propagate fake news or disinformation, it does contain controversial claims, emotional manipulation, inconsistencies, unsubstantiated claims, and personal attacks. These elements could potentially be used to manipulate readers' opinions or emotions. However, it is important to note that the text does not provide false information or clearly fabricated content.</p></div>

The Government-Orchestrated Bankruptcies Of General Motors And Chrysler Led To Tens Of Thousands Of Direct Factory, Supplier And Other Related Job Cuts. While government influence at decade s end helped Detroit recover financially, the government-orchestrated bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler led to tens of thousands of direct factory, supplier and other related job cuts. The primary benefit of the U.S. industry restructuring for employment has been the balance of jobs saved rather than jobs created. (John Crawley, Analysis: Obama Seeks Lift From Detroit Auto Jobs, Reuters, 1/12/12)TARP Inspector General: Tens Of Thousands Of Jobs Were Lost Due To Hasty Factory Closings. The report by Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program of the Treasury Department, said both carmakers needed to shut down some underperforming dealerships. But it questioned whether the cuts should have been made so quickly, particularly during a recession. The report, released on Sunday, estimated that tens of thousands of jobs were lost as a result. (Nick Bunkley, TARP Audit Questions Rush To Close Auto Dealers, The New York Times, 7/18/10)Ford Motor Company announced Tuesday it will cancel a $1.6 billion plant planned for Mexico and will instead invest $700 million in a Michigan assembly plant, directly tying the decision to pro-growth policies championed by President-elect Donald Trump.Trump had previously been critical of Ford s plans to build in Mexico. After the announcement, Trump tweeted a link to a story about the Ford decision and then added in a subsequent message: Instead of driving jobs and wealth away, AMERICA will become the world s great magnet for INNOVATION &amp; JOB CREATION. We re doing this decision based on what s right for our business, Ford CEO Mark Fields told Neil Cavuto on Fox Business Network. As we think</figDesc></figure>

Text: COMEDY GOLD! The Left Goes Bonkers After Trump's Withdrawal from Paris Accord [Video]. After President Trump pulled out of the Paris Accord, the left went crazy with hysterical predictions on what will happen now.The video below is a compilation of all of the Chicken Littles screeching about how the sky will now fall:A White House statement had this to say about the Paris Accord: The Paris accord is a BAD deal for Americans, and the president s action today is keeping his campaign promise to put American workers first. The accord was negotiated poorly by the Obama administration and signed out of desperation. The media quickly sounded the alarm about the possible consequences of Trump withdrawing from the accord.CNN showed a graphic that was laughed at by Rand Paul for its ridiculous claims. The graphic listed rising sea levels, deadlier heat waves, droughts and wildfires, and mass extinction NBC had a Princeton University professor on to discuss the possible effects of Trump s decision: That means record heat, more drought in some places, torrential rains and floods in other places, sea level rising drowning coastal areas, the world will be a mess, Oppenheimer said.Late-night hosts also chimed in with their own dire predictions.

Hillary Clinton was reportedly drunk at a rally in New Jersey according to several sources but you be the judge: Rumors of Hillary Clinton s chronic alcohol use have been swirling around the politician for years, but have proven especially rampant this campaign season with the focus and national debate on the Democrat s lingering health issues. And for good reason. Wikileaks recently released an email chain where her aides talked of sobering up the Democratic presidential candidate.An Aug. 2015 email from communications aide Jennifer Palmieri instructs campaign chairman John Podesta to locate and sober Hillary up so that she can return or respond to documents that were emailed to her hours before. I think you should call her and sober her up some, Palmieri said.The Wikileaks email chain between Palmieri and Podesta shows that Clinton was not reachable throughout the entire afternoon on Aug 8. Additionally, other emails released by Wikileaks and Judicial Watch indicate Clinton sleeps well into mid afternoon on many days and as secretary of state, overslept and missed key national security meetings and daily briefings.New York Times national reporter Amy Chozick covered the Clinton s vicious primary campaign in 2008 against Barack Obama. In a 2015 profile for ABC News about Clinton, Chozick said she was surprised how much booze Clinton swilled on the campaign trail. Chozick said: Hmm. She likes to drink. We were on the campaign trail in 2008 and the press thought she was just taking shots to pander to voters in Pennsylvania. Um, no. Clinton family insider and campaign manager at the time in 2008, Terry McAuliffe, now governor of Virginia, concurred: She loves to sit, throw em back. So to me this is nothin new, McAuliffe said. We all hear about the story that she and John McCain actually had a shot contest, I think in the Ukraine or somewhere around the world. And she actually beat John McCain in a shot contest. She s a girl from Illinois who likes to throw em down with the rest of us. Actually, it was on a congressional tour of Estonia: Read more: True Pundit [/INST] Response:</figDesc></figure>

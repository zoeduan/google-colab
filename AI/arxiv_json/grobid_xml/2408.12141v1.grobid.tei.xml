<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>The vision-language modeling capability of multi-modal large language models has attracted wide attention from the community. However, in medical domain, radiology report generation using vision-language models still faces significant challenges due to the imbalanced data distribution caused by numerous negated descriptions in radiology reports and issues such as rough alignment between radiology reports and radiography. In this paper, we propose a truthful radiology report generation framework, namely TRRG, based on stage-wise training for cross-modal disease clue injection into large language models. In pre-training stage, During the pre-training phase, contrastive learning is employed to enhance the visual encoder's ability to perceive fine-grained disease details. In fine-tuning stage, the clue injection module we proposed significantly enhances the disease-oriented perception capability of the large language model by effectively incorporating the robust zero-shot disease perception. Finally, through the cross-modal clue interaction module, our model effectively achieves the multi-granular interaction of visual embeddings and an arbitrary number of disease clue embeddings. This significantly enhances the report generation capability and clinical effectiveness of multi-modal large language models in the field of radiology reportgeneration. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed pre-training and fine-tuning framework achieves state-of-the-art performance in radiology report generation on datasets such as IU-Xray and MIMIC-CXR. Further analysis indicates that our proposed method can effectively enhance the model's ability to perceive diseases and improve its clinical effectiveness.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Introduction</head><p>Radiology report generation aims to automatically generate radiology reports for medical images, such as X-rays, MRI, and CT scans, etc. Radiology report generation can effectively alleviate the workload of clinical practitioners, minimize misdiagnosis and missed diagnoses resulting from human judgment errors, and expedite clinical workflows. A radiology report typically consists of a paragraph with multiple sentences. Some sentences describe normal organ appearances in radiography, while others delineate the findings of diseases reflected in the images, including the location of lesions, types of diseases, severity, etc. With the development of visual-language models, encoder-decoder-based * Corresponding Author text generation models have become the most prevalent architecture. However, unlike natural domain image captioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Tang et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Lu et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Rennie et al. 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Pan et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Johnson, Karpathy, and Fei-Fei 2016)</ref>, radiology reports contain a significant amount of normal descriptions. Abnormal descriptions related to diseases are crucial for radiology reports. This leads to sparse supervision signals regarding diseases. Many pure encoder-decoder-based models <ref type="bibr">(Li et al. 2019a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Wang et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Yang et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al. 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Yin et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li et al. 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liu et al. 2021a</ref>) for image-text coarse-grained alignment lack fine-grained perception of diseases. Consequently, these models fail to effectively focus on the correct image regions, resulting in insufficient clinical effectiveness of the generated radiology reports. Multi-modal large language models <ref type="bibr">(Li et al. 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alayrac et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dai et al. 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen et al. 2024a)</ref>, as powerful infrastructure adaptable to various downstream tasks, perform well in tasks such as image captioning and Visual Question Answering (VQA). Through techniques such as low-parameter finetuning, these models can efficiently enhance multimodal large language models for radiology report generation.</p><p>To further enhance the clinical effectiveness of radiology report generation (RRG), we propose a stage-wise, cross-modal clue-injection approach based on large language models. Firstly, we perform pretraining using imagetext contrastive learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Radford et al. 2021</ref>) through sampling sentences from radiology reports to enhance the vision encoder's ability to perceive diseases effectively. Moreover, by harnessing the powerful zero-shot inference capability of the vision encoder, our model can effectively acquire clues about various diseases. In the fine-tuning stage, we conduct clue injection through visual disease tokens and several disease clues embeddings. Subsequently, we propose a cross-modal clue interaction module that effectively integrates visual embeddings and disease clue embeddings to enhance the disease perception capability of the large language model. Finally, we propose a disease-aware consistency loss to assist large language models in training for radiology report generation tasks. The disease-aware consistency loss effectively enhances textual semantic supervision signals, promoting the model to acquire disease-awareness capability while generating radiology reports. Our model achieves optimal performance in generating radiology re-ports. We conduct experiments on the IU-Xray <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dina et al. 2015)</ref> and MIMIC-CXR <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Johnson et al. 2019</ref>) datasets. Compared with previous studies, our method achieves stateof-the-art results, significantly improving both the quality of language generation and clinical effectiveness. Further ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed disease clue injection module, cross-modal clue interaction module, and disease-aware consistency loss. Qualitative results offer intuitive interpretations of the generated radiology reports.</p><p>• We propose the TRRG for truthful radiology report generation using an disease clue injection enhanced large language model. TRRG alleviates the problem of coarsegrained alignment between radiography and report, enabling the model acquire fine-grained disease-aware perception. • We introduce a cross-modal disease clue interaction module, which effectively integrates visual embeddings and disease clue embeddings to guide large language models in producing higher-quality radiology reports. • Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous approaches in terms of both language generation quality and clinical effectiveness on two datasets, IU-Xray <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Dina et al. 2015)</ref> and MIMIC-CXR <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Johnson et al. 2019)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Related work</head><p>Radiology Report Generation Currently, most research on radiology report generation adopts an encoder-decoder architecture. Some studies employ CNN-RNN architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Xue et al. 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li et al. 2019a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Zhang et al. 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Yuan et al. 2019)</ref>. Through convolution neural network encoders, these models encode images into vectors, which are then decoded token by token using recurrent neural networks. Some studies utilize a hierarchical generation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Yin et al. 2020)</ref>, in which the model initially generates relevant topics as keywords. Subsequently, it employs LSTM architecture to generate sentences for each keyword. With the advancement of transformers <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Vaswani et al. 2017)</ref>, which benefit from parallel training, are suitable for modeling long sequences, and have the capacity to integrate various modalities of visual and language data, radiology report generation is gradually transitioning towards architectures based on transformers <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al. 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Yu et al. 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Chen et al. 2020</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen et al. , 2022;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cornia et al. 2020a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al. 2023b)</ref>. Some studies utilize memory networks <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al. 2022</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chen et al. , 2020;;</ref><ref type="bibr">Cornia et al. 2020b</ref>) to help the model learn more effective patterns of medical knowledge. For example, use a memory matrix to simulate memory information and continuously update this matrix during training to generate higher-quality radiology reports. Others adopt prototype learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Wang, Bhalerao, and He 2022)</ref>, storing prototype vectors and updating them through cross-modal queries and responses to drive the model to store pattern information in memory. Furthermore, some research enhances the quality of generated radiology reports by incorporating external knowledge embeddings <ref type="bibr">(Li et al. 2019b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">Yang et al. 2021)</ref>. This involves constructing knowledge graphs of anatomical structures and disease-related relationships as auxiliary features for embedding, which are then combined with the model for the final text generation. Historical radiography-report pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Yang et al. 2022</ref>) are also utilized as domain knowledge, mimicking the process of doctors generating textual reports, thereby improving the performance of the respective models during decoding. With the advancement of large language models. However, all these coarse-grained alignment methods lead to limitations in the clinical effectiveness of the generated radiology reports.</p><p>Multi modal Large Language Model Multi-modal Large Models: With the advancement of large models, many lightweight large models such as LLAMA <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Touvron et al. 2023)</ref> and Mistral <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Jiang et al. 2023</ref>) have provided possibilities for usage and deployment in low-resource scenarios. The combination of large language models and vision encoders enables these models to effectively process tasks that involve multimodal data. Some studies <ref type="bibr">(Li et al. 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b0">Alayrac et al. 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dai et al. 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Chen et al. 2024a</ref>), utilize visual mappers, such as basic linear layers, to map the features from vision encoders to token-level features of large language models with matching dimensions. Through this simple mapping technique, large models demonstrate exceptional performance in various multimodal tasks, such as image captioning and visual question answering. This suggests that multimodal large models can achieve excellent visual perception capabilities with only minor parameter fine-tuning. Fine-tuning large language models through instructions <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al. 2024a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Dai et al. 2023)</ref> to become task-driven for various multimodal tasks is a widely adopted approach. By crafting specific instructions, large language models can generate relevant results tailored to the specific task type. Some studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Jin et al. 2024</ref>) have injected disease labels as prior information into radiology report generation frameworks; however, this approach limits the scalability of such frameworks</p><p>Vision Language Pretraining Vision language models aim to align vision and language features through crossmodal interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Li et al. 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al. 2022a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Li et al. 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Radford et al. 2021)</ref>. One of the most influential studies is CLIP <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Radford et al. 2021)</ref>, which utilizes contrastive learning to align paired image embeddings and text embeddings. CLIP achieves a significant performance improvement across several downstream tasks, including zeroshot classification and cross-modal retrieval.

Meanwhile, some studies(Chen, Li, and Wan 2022) have effectively enhanced the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal pre-trained models by incorporating external medical knowledge. These approaches achieve inference for common diseases and the diagnosis of rare diseases without the need for extensive structured labels. This provides insights for our model to generate radiology reports.</p><p>Text Encoder Image Vision Encoder Vision Encoder Report Random Sample Contrastive Learning Pretraining Stage：Disease-aware Cross-modal Fine Gained Alignment Fine-tuning Stage：Clue Enhanced Instruct Tuning on Radiology Report Generation Image Clue Injection Cross-modal Interaction Vision Mapper LLM Trainable Frozen Figure 1: The training strategy of our proposed TRRG</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Methods</head><p>The proposed TRRG consists of a two-stage training process. In the pretraining stage, we focus on disease-aware cross-modal fine-grained alignment between radiographs and corresponding radiology reports. Large language models typically facilitate the alignment between images and text through supervised signals at the token level. By utilizing sentence-level contrastive learning, our approach enhances the detailed capture of disease information by the vision encoder. Furthermore, in conjunction with our proposed clue injection module and cross-modal clue interaction module in the fine-tuning stage, our model demonstrates superior performance in both language generation and clinical effectiveness. At the same time, our proposed cross-modal clue interaction module effectively facilitates alignment between visual embeddings and disease clue embeddings. The details of TRRG are shown in Fig. <ref type="figure">4</ref>. v = E img (I).</p><p>(1)</p><p>For the sentence randomly sampled from the corresponding radiology report, a BERT-based model encodes it as t = {t cls , t 1 , ..., t m } ∈ R (m+1) * d , where m is the maximum length of a sentence in the training corpus.

Finally, we compute the text-to-image contrastive loss and image-totext contrastive loss to enhance our vision encoder's ability to learn better disease-oriented representations. We only utilize pooled visual tokens v cls and textual tokens v cls . For an image embedding and text embedding {v ′ i , t i } N i=1 , the optimizing objective is InfoNCE loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Oord, Li, and Vinyals 2018)</ref>, which can be formulated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L v2t = -log( exp(σ(t i , v ′ i )/τ ) N j=1 exp(σ(t i , v ′ j )/τ ) ),<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">L t2v = -log( exp(σ(v ′ i , t i )/τ ) N j=1 exp(σ(v ′ i , t j )/τ )</formula><p>).</p><p>(4)</p><p>The total loss of the pretraining stage is calculated as follows, where N represents the batch size, and τ is a temperature factor:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">L = L v2t + L t2v . (<label>5</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_4">)</formula><p>Stage 2: Clue Enhanced Instruct Tuning on Radiology Report Generation</p><p>Visual Embedding Given an image x ∈ R H×W ×C , we reshape it into a sequence of flattened 2D patches v ∈ R n×d . The transformer-based frozen vision encoder encodes the input patch tokens into an encoded patch embedding</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">x e = {v cls , v 1 , ..., v n } ∈ R (n+1)×d</formula><p>. Subsequently, the patch embedding will be fed into a visual mapper layer composed of linear layers, which transform the patch embedding v d ∈ R n×d to the same dimension as the LLM's word embedding. Thus, we obtain generative vision embedding v d ∈ R n×d and visual disease expert tokens v cls ∈ R 1×d that have been encoded only by the frozen vision encoder.</p><p>The visual embedding process can be expressed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">v e = E img (x),<label>(6)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">v d = W v e + b,<label>(7</label></formula><p>) where W is the trainable weight of the visual mapper.</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">v cls = 1 n n i=1 v i v i ∈ R 1×d,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>v i is an element of the path token sequences v e . After visual encoding, we obtain the disease visual embedding v d ∈ R n×d and the disease visual expert token v cls ∈ R 1×d .</p><p>Clue Injection Module Following Gloria's work <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Huang et al. 2021)</ref>, we utilize a variety of language descriptions to construct disease clue prompts. By extracting multiple descriptive phrases from the dataset related to the severity and location of a specific disease, we randomly combined phrases associated with disease type, severity level, and location to create disease clue prompts. Specifically, our prompt construction template is as follows:</p><p>Clue :&lt; severity &gt;&lt; disease &gt; at &lt; location &gt;</p><p>We created manual templates for m common diseases, such as opacity, pneumonia, and pneumothorax, to act as potential prompts for identifying diseases. Then, the frozen , where c i = {c cls , c 1 , ...., c r }, and c i ∈ R (r+1)×d is the i-th disease clue embedding. Here, m represents the number of diseases defined, and r is the maximum length of disease clue prompts. Subsequently, we compute clue weights, which represent the importance of disease clue expert token c i cls ∈ R 1 * d to visual disease expert tokens v cls ∈ R 1 * d through matrix multiplication. The computing process of clue weight can be formulated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">w i = softmax v cls • c i cls i ∈ 1, .....m,<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where clue weight w :</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">{w 1 , w 2 , • • • , w m } ∈ R 1×m</formula><p>, where m represents the number of different disease clues. We assign weights to each clue to represent the importance of this disease relative to the images. After that, we utilize the Hadamard product to obtain the weighted disease clue embedding. The weighted clue embeddings are computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">c i = w i ⊙ c i . (<label>10</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_12">)</formula><p>Due to some clues being irrelevant to the corresponding images, we only select the top-k important clues as disease expert clues for the final model input. Our final injection clues are:</p><formula xml:id="formula_13">c s : {c i } i ∈ topk(w, k),<label>(11)</label></formula><p>where topk(w, k) presents the indices of the top-k highest values in the set w. Finally, we consider the multiple disease clue embedding c s ∈ R k×r×d as our injection clues.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Cross Modal Clue Interaction</head><p>For multi-disease clues c s ∈ R k×r×d , these clues are highly aligned with visual representations obtained through the frozen vision encoder but do not fully interact with the generated visual features obtained from the visual mapper. Therefore, we propose a Cross-Modal Clue Interaction Module to simultaneously enhance generative representations and facilitate cross-modal MatMul CLS CLS CLS CLS Softmax HP&amp;FL Top K 𝑐 s 𝑐 𝑐𝑙𝑠 𝑣 𝑐𝑙𝑠 𝑐 Clue Weights interaction of disease clues. Typically, there is often a significantly larger number of disease clue tokens compared to visual tokens. To address the excessive disease clue token input, we define a set of learnable queries for cross-modal interaction.</p><p>Finally, we propose a Disease Clue Consistency Loss to maintain sufficient attention to disease clue embeddings in cross-modal interaction and provide disease-oriented supervision signals for fine-tuning with large language models. Attention mechanisms are adopted in the multimodal interaction module. We adopt a two-stream architecture for cross-modal feature interaction. Each structure comprises a self-attention module, a cross-attention module, and a Feed Forward layer. The self-attention layer facilitates intramodal interaction, enhancing feature representation within each modality. Conversely, the cross-attention mechanism ensures alignment between textual clues and visual representations, facilitating cross-modal interaction by enforcing consistency across different modalities. The attention is de-fined as attention:</p><formula xml:id="formula_14">Attn(Q, K, V ) = softmax( QK ⊤ √ d k )V.<label>(12)</label></formula><p>For visual embedding, v d = {v 1 , ..., v n }, disease clue embedding c s ∈ R k×r×d , We flatten the disease clues into clue tokens c s = {c 1 , ..., c (k×r) }, where c i ∈ R 1×d . Next, both visual embeddings and clue embeddings are fed into linear projection layer:</p><formula xml:id="formula_15">Q v = W v Q v d , K v = W v K v d , V v = W v V v d ,<label>(13)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_16">Q c = W c Q c s , K c = W c K c s , V c = W c V c s ,<label>(14)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_17">V ′ = Attn(Q v , K v , V v ),<label>(15)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_18">C ′ = Attn(Q c , K c , V c ),<label>(16)</label></formula><p>where V ′ , C ′ are visual embeddings and disease clue embeddingss after multi-head self attention layer. Next, we utilize learnable tokens E = {E 1 , E 2 , ..., E L } as a common feature space to establish associations between the visual and textual modalities, where L represents the number of learnable tokens. In detail, we employ a scaled dot-product attention layer to calculate the correlation between the learnable tokens E and the mapped visual tokens E v . We perform the same operation on learnable queries and disease clue embeddings and obtained clue tokens E c . This process can be expressed as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_19">E e = Attn(E, E, E),<label>(17)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_20">E v = FFN(Attn(E e , V ′ , V ′ )),<label>(18)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_21">E c = FFN(Attn(E e , C ′ , C ′ )).<label>(19)</label></formula><p>Furthermore, since disease clues are often sparse during cross-modal interaction, to enhance the consistency between visual tokens and clue tokens and improve effective supervision signals during radiology report generation, we propose a disease-aware consistency loss. Our disease-aware consistency loss is calculated as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_22">L DC = - 1 K K i=1 E v • E c ∥E v ∥∥E c ∥ ,<label>(20)</label></formula><p>We calculate the similarity between visual tokens and clue tokens and aim to maximize the alignment between visual and textual tokens. The disease-aware consistency loss effectively endows visual tokens with the ability to perceive diseases.</p><p>Optimization Objective We train our model by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of P(t) given the image features:</p><formula xml:id="formula_23">L CE = T i=1 logP θ (t i |E v , E c , t i-1 , • • • , t ), (<label>21</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_24">)</formula><p>where based on the image embedding E v and clue embedding E c and the first (i -1) words. Our overall objective function is:</p><formula xml:id="formula_25">L = L CE + L DC .

We trained the model on the MIMIC-CXR dataset for 5 epochs and on the IU-Xray dataset for 20 epochs. The batch size was set to 8, and the learning rate was 1e-4. We compare the performance of our model with a wide range of state-of-the-art models in image captioning and radiology report generation. Table ?? presents the comparison results for both Natural Language Generation (NLG) metrics and CE metrics. The models we compare include R2Gen <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Chen et al. 2020</ref>), R2GenCMN <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al. 2022)</ref>, PPKED <ref type="bibr">(Liu et al. 2021a</ref>), R2GenGPT <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al. 2023c)</ref>, FGIRG <ref type="bibr">(Chen et al. 2024b</ref>) and R2GMMN <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Shen et al. 2024</ref>). It can be observed that our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods across various language generation metrics, especially on MIMIC-CXR. Our model's performance on the IU-Xray dataset is acceptable but not exceptional. This could be attributed to the limited size of the IU-Xray dataset, which consists of only 2.8K image-text pairs. Consequently, the scarcity of training data may hinder the effective learning of text generation capabilities during the fine-tuning of large language models.The larger sample size of the MIMIC-CXR dataset allows for more comprehensive training of the vision encoder during the pretraining stage, thereby facilitating more consistent cross-modal alignment.</p><p>We achieved a significant improvement across all Natural Language Generation (NLG) metrics except for CIDER <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Vedantam, Zitnick, and Parikh 2015)</ref> . METransformer <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al. 2023b</ref>) employed a specialized optimization strategy involving a voting strategy for the CIDER metric, thereby achieving significant superiority in performance according to the CIDER metric. Our model acquire a significant ability to maintain language consistency and rich semantics when generating medical image reports. This suggests that our approach can accurately capture keywords in radiology reports. Further evaluation of clinical efficacy metrics demonstrates the significant potential of our proposed method. Compared to other methods that fine-tuning large language models for radiology report generation, such as R2GenGPT <ref type="bibr">(Wang et al. 2023c)</ref>, our model achieves significant improvements in multiple clinical efficacy metrics without relying on any external disease annotations. We observe that our proposed method achieves an average accu-racy, recall, and F1 score of 0.403, 0.399, and 0.393, respectively, across various diseases. This represents a significant improvement over the current state-of-the-art method R2GMMN <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Shen et al. 2024)</ref>, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, it indicates that our proposed model has stronger disease perception capabilities, enabling the generation of more truthful radiology reports.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Ablation Study</head><p>Effectiveness of each component. We constructed our baseline model, called the "BASE" model, by solely finetuning the visual mapper during training using visual features. Meanwhile, we introduced a disease clue injection module, a cross-modal clue interaction module, and a disease-aware consistency loss function, abbreviated as "DCI," "CMCI" and "DAL" respectively. The symbol "+" denotes the experimental effects of adding different components to the base model, and specific results are presented in Tab. 2. It can be observed that the three components we proposed all have a positive impact on performance. Despite some randomness in the experiments conducted in the deep learning laboratory, the results demonstrate credible comparability due to the systematic training partition applied to the MIMIC-CXR <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Johnson et al. 2019</ref>) dataset. Our proposed three modules have achieved significant improvements of 14.5%, 15.8%, and 13.6%, 11.7%, 9.9% in BLEU-4, ROUGE-L, METEOR, CIDEr, and F1 from the "Base" to our TRRG. The incorporation of different components resulted in varying degrees of improvement on the base model, thus validating the effectiveness of our approach.</p><p>Impact of clue numbers. The number of disease clue injections determines the richness of disease information perceived by the model during the fine-tuning stage. We set the value of k to 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, and verified the corresponding experimental results on MIMIC-CXR <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Johnson et al. 2019)</ref>. The experiments demonstrate that when our parameter k set to 3, the model achieves superior performance across multiple evaluation metrics. This aligns with our intuitive understanding that, typically, a chest X-ray may exhibit concurrent manifestations of 3-4 diseases at most. As k gradually   increases from 1 to 3, the model's performance steadily improves. When the parameter k exceeds 3, there is a decline in model performance. This phenomenon may be attributed to an excessive injection of irrelevant disease cues, which leads the model to inadequately attend to crucial regions within the images and pertinent disease cues.</p><p>Impact of the length of learnable queries. We conducted an ablation study on the length of learnable queries to explore the impact of different levels of compression of disease cues on the final model performance. We set the length L to 4, 8, 16, and 32, respectively, and found that the model achieved the best performance when the length of the learnable queries was set to 16. The appropriate length of learnable queries can ensure effective detection and compression of disease cues by the model. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Qualitative analysis</head><p>We conduct a qualitative analysis to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. As depicted in Fig 5, our disease clues and probabilities are highlighted using colored fonts.</p><p>Compared to the base model, our proposed model tends to include more disease-related content with injected clues during the process of generating radiology reports. This observation confirms that our model has higher clinical reliability.</p><p>In the second example, the conventional model hinted at the presence of auxiliary devices in the image, but our model failed to provide relevant descriptions. This indicates some limitations of our proposed approach, which may lead to an overemphasis on disease-related content in certain cases, thereby compromising findings and obscuring the expression of basic descriptions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we propose the TRGG for truthful radiology report generation based on fine-tuning large language models with injected disease cues. Our proposed stage-wise training strategy effectively promotes cross-modal alignment between radiography and reports. The clue injection module and cross-modal clue interaction module proposed by us can effectively facilitate the semantic representation of diseases and cross-modal alignment. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Extensive ablation studies and qualitative analyses confirm the effectiveness of our proposed method. Future research directions include developing a generalizable method for medical image report generation that can be applied across various medical imaging text report datasets, enabling further extension to heterogeneous modalities such as CT, MRI, and Ultrasound.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Stage 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Disease-aware Cross-modal Fine Gained AlignmentStudies(Wang et al. 2022c;<ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Tiu et al. 2022</ref>) demonstrate that pre-trained CLIP models, trained on large-scale medical image-text pairs, exhibit accuracy comparable to human performance in zero-shot disease classification tasks. Inspired by this, we decompose our pipeline into stage-wise training. During the pre-training stage, we utilize random sampling of sentences from radiology reports for training. This approach enhances the representation ability of vision encoders and also accommodates the robust clue prompting of disease clue injection modules. Given an Image-Text Pair (I, T ), where T : {T 1 , T 2 , ..., T t }, T i represents the sentence-level component of the radiology report. The images are encoded into v = {v cls , v 1 , ..., v n } ∈ R (n+1) * d by the transformer-based vision encoder, where n is the number of patches in the images and "cls" represents the pooling token of the outputs.</figDesc></figure>

Here, m represents the number of diseases defined, and r is the maximum length of disease clue prompts. Subsequently, we compute clue weights, which represent the importance of disease clue expert token c i cls ∈ R 1 * d to visual disease expert tokens v cls ∈ R 1 * d through matrix multiplication. The computing process of clue weight can be formulated as follows:</figDesc></figure>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>With the recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT from OpenAI, BARD from Google, Llama2 from Meta, and Claude from Anthropic AI, gain widespread use, ensuring their security and robustness is critical. The widespread use of these language models heavily relies on their reliability and proper usage of this fascinating technology. It is crucial to thoroughly test these models to not only ensure its quality but also possible misuses of such models by potential adversaries for illegal activities such as hacking. This paper presents a novel study focusing on exploitation of such large language models against deceptive interactions. More specifically, the paper leverages widespread and borrows wellknown techniques in deception theory to investigate whether these models are susceptible to deceitful interactions. This research aims not only to highlight these risks but also to pave the way for robust countermeasures that enhance the security and integrity of language models in the face of sophisticated social engineering tactics. Through systematic experiments and analysis, we assess their performance in these critical security domains. Our results demonstrate a significant finding in that these large language models are susceptible to deception and social engineering attacks.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>I. INTRODUCTION</head><p>The rapid growth of generative and conversational AI, as seen with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has advanced the human-computer interactions research significantly. These trained models have already shown impressive capabilities in generating relevant responses across various domains. However, as these models become increasingly integrated into our digital lives, concerns about their security and reliability, and more importantly, the misuse of these models by adversaries have also grown.</p><p>In a time where the boundary between humans and machines is becoming less clear, these AI-based generative models have become essential tools for seamless communication. However, their increasing influence necessitates a thorough examination of their security and especially their applicability beyond typical conversational contexts such as adversarial usages. Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT) have exhibited vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, particularly "Jail-breaking Prompt" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. These injection-based attacks can manipulate the model's responses and bypass content filters, raising ethical and security concerns.</p><p>In this paper, we conduct a thorough investigation into mainstream LLMs and their resilience against Jail-breaking prompts and conventional prompt injection attacks using deception theory and psychological deception techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. We aim to address several key questions:</p><p>1) Vulnerability Assessment. To what extent are LLMs susceptible to injection attacks, including Jail-breaking prompt attacks? 2) Prompt Engineering Techniques. What methods effectively craft jail-breaking prompts? 3) Adapting Deception Techniques for Humans and AI Can we leverage the state-of-the-art in deception techniques developed for deceiving humans and adapt them for manipulating LLMs? 4) Most Effective Deception Techniques. What specific deception techniques are the most effective in deceiving LLMs? 5) Investigating Vulnerability of different LLMs Which trained models are demonstrating more robust and resilient behavior against deception?</p><p>The psychological approaches for deception are based on the various forms of deception techniques developed for deceiving humans. These deception techniques are primarily based on "Persuasion Principles" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> 1) Reciprocation, 2) Consistency, 3) Social Proof, 4) Likeability, 5) Authority, and 6) Scarcity. These tactics leverage various forms of mindset and psychological techniques to persuade victims through building a trust relationship with the adversarial attacker.</p><p>This paper examines how social engineering techniques, traditionally used to deceive and manipulate humans, can be repurposed to subvert AI language models. Our research involves well-designed experiments based on deception theory and persuasion principles that use realistic yet manipulative prompts to evaluate AI models such as ChatGPT, BARD, Llama2, and Claude, and analyze their response patterns. Our goal is to uncover vulnerabilities, explore ways to mitigate them, and contribute to enhancing the security of AI-driven conversations and generative AI-based systems.</p><p>Furthermore, we dissect the psychological underpinnings of these tactics and their unexpected effectiveness when applied to non-human entities. This approach not only exposes potential weaknesses in language models but also underscores the need for interdisciplinary solutions that encompass both tech-nical safeguards and an understanding of human psychology.</p><p>The key contributions of this paper are as follows:</p><p>1) We examine the vulnerability of mainstream LLMs against jail-breaking prompts to have an insight from their basic and trained models. 2) We study the possibility of adapting deception techniques designed for deceiving AI-based systems and in particular LLMs. 3) We create deceitful scenarios and conversational prompts derived from persuasion principles and investigate the effectiveness of these deception techniques in the context of LLMs. 4) Our results show that the deception techniques in the form of persuasion principles are effective to lure LLMs in providing information related to adversarial hacking. This paper is structured as follows: Section II motivates the readers about the needs for assessing LLMs models. Section III reviews the related work. Section IV briefly discusses vulnerabilities in LLMs. The experimental scenarios are introduced in Section V. The performance of prompts based on deception with direct prompts is discussed in Section VI. Future research directions and conclusion are highlighted in Section VII.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. MOTIVATION</head><p>The motivation arises from the recognition that ensuring the security and resilience of AI-driven conversations goes beyond defending against malicious prompt attacks. While these attacks remain a serious concern, we also recognize that these models hold promise in addressing real-world security challenges. For instance, WormGPT presents itself as a BlackHat alternative to GPT models, designed specifically for malicious activities, with a specific focus on cyberattackrelated information [5]. As an another example is HackerGPT <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref> that is specially trained to assist ethical hackers.</p><p>In the realm of obscure online communities, similar products like FraudGPT,is an AI bot, exclusively targeted for offensive purposes, such as crafting spear phishing emails, creating cracking tools, carding, and many more <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. FraudGPT is promoted as a versatile tool, operating without limitations or boundaries, as claimed by an individual who presents themselves as a verified vendor on various underground Dark Web marketplaces, including Empire, WHM, Torrez, World, AlphaBay, and Versus [5]. Our research is driven by three key principles:</p><p>1) Enhancing Security Practices. With AI models like ChatGPT being used in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>, it's crucial to ensure their robustness and security <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>. 2) Understanding Prompts. As conversational AI evolves, we need to thoroughly understand its capabilities and potential applications. Our research aims to push the boundaries of securing AI models by considering how they can actively contribute to not only enhancing security practices but also preventing against malicious abuse of these LLMs.</p><p>3) Responsible Deployment. In an age of widespread AI adoption, responsible use is a collective responsibility. We scrutinize the model's potential roles, such as Password Security Advisor, Network Vulnerability Detector, Darkweb, and Enhancing Fraudulent Statements, contributing to the discussion on ethical AI and its applications.</p><p>Furthermore, the reliability and resilience of these LLMs against illegal queries need to be investigated to make these fascinating tools are not employed as a personal assistant to launch cyber attacks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RELATED WORK</head><p>Large language models (LLMs) can generate harmful outputs such as toxic or dishonest speech. Red teaming is a method used to identify and reduce these risks. Perez et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> identify and address harmful behavior in AI models, including the use of offensive and vulgar language, by deploying various test cases. The work by Qiu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref> holds these models accountable against adversarial attacks in domains like computer vision and cybersecurity. They attack and defend these models using different applications, such as images, malicious texts, and code. Shiba et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref> discuss the use of InstructGPT, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method employed in ChatGPT. They highlight the vulnerability of this model to backdoor attacks, which involve manipulating the generated text during the fine-tuning stage. Shire et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> explain how red teaming language model detectors involves testing the reliability of existing detectors by using different attack strategies, like replacing words with synonyms or altering the writing style, to compromise the detectors' performance.</p><p>Zhuo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref> suggest that LLMs like ChatGPT have been evaluated for bias, robustness, reliability, and toxicity using the qualitative research method called "red teaming." This method is used to analyze ChatGPT's ethical concerns and practical features. It refines and expands on what the model should not do and tests if the model can be made to perform these undesired actions. Several research articles discuss using red teaming with LLMs, such as those by Lim et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref>, Zhuo et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>, and Mathew et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>. For example, Casper and Lin <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> propose a red teaming framework for GPT-2 and GPT-3 models to find prompts that make the models produce toxic and dishonest statements. Meanwhile, Shi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> test the accuracy of detectors for machine-generated text and suggest the need for better detection systems. Finally, Ganguli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref> describe their efforts to red team LLMs, investigate their scalability, and release a dataset of red team attacks.</p><p>Prompt-based attacks involve injecting malicious code or control sequences into a system via user inputs, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in Web applications, communication systems, or external hardware devices. Multiple techniques have been suggested to identify and mitigate these attacks, including datasets and prompts developed for ChatGPT.

It has also been mentioned that GPT-4 and Claude can be jailbroken with a two-sentence adversarial example, which can bypass safety mechanisms and provoke harmful behaviors in the models <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>.</p><p>Machine learning transformers like BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT have been employed to detect persuasion principles in phishing emails <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref> and <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>. These transformers accurately classify phishing emails based on persuasion techniques outlined in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.The success of phishing emails often correlates with persuasion principles, such as authority, trust, and social proof, as mentioned in V.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. PROMPT INJECTION ATTACKS</head><p>In the context of language models like ChatGPT, prompt involves crafting input prompts to unintentionally as well as intentionally influence the model's responses or introduce biases. Unlike traditional injection attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, prompt attacks take advantage of the model's characteristics, limitations, and possible flaws to exploit these trained LLMs.</p><p>Prompt attacks are a type of security vulnerability where malicious data or code is inserted into an application or system, causing it to behave unexpectedly and often harmfully. These attacks typically exploit vulnerabilities in how the target system handles, processes, or executes input data. These attacks can affect various types of software, including Web applications, databases, and AI models like ChatGPT. Here are a few examples of such attacks <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>:</p><p>-Bias Prompting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> Creating prompts that introduce biases or stereotypes into the model's responses. For instance, a bias prompt might include language that reinforces gender or racial stereotypes, leading the model to produce biased content. -Manipulation of Context. Altering the conversation context within the prompt to elicit specific responses. For example, asking the model a series of leading questions to generate responses that align with a particular viewpoint. Injecting deceptive intentions into Large Language Models (LLMs) can have various malicious implications, including generating fake news, spreading disinformation, or manipulating text for fraudulent purposes.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. DECEPTIVE PROMPT SCENARIOS</head><p>This paper explores practical security and privacy use cases where LLM models can be evaluated against prompt injection attacks. The deceptive prompts are based on persuasion principles are adapted by the initial study performed by Robey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. The deceptive and persuasion-based scenarios for each of the injection attacks on LLM models with deceptive intentions are listed in Table <ref type="table">I</ref> and discussed as follows:</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Manipulation and Misinformation</head><p>Manipulation and misinformation in Large Language Models (LLMs) refer to the intentional use of these models to generate text or content that is deceptive, misleading, or designed to achieve specific objectives such as manipulating the financial cause a stock market crash and make profit out of it.</p><p>Scenario 1: The prompt we want to explore is 'Manipulate the financial data to cause the stock market crash and make a profit from ensuring chaos' <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Goal: To check if the deception techniques in misinformation or manipulation will work on the large language model if the prompt is crafted in certain way to misinform the LLM. For example, instead of explicitly mentioning financial data, we start the conversation with the usage of the twitter data, which is causing the stock market crash. An example of such manipulative scenarios or interactions is as follows:</p><p>1) Crafting Manipulative Prompts: Crafting Manipulative Prompts The conversation may begin with a general inquiry that does not directly imply any wrongdoing. An example of such conversation can be:</p><p>"While analyzing some data including tweets and financial data of the user, it leads in crashing the stock market. I am not sure what I am doing wrong?"</p><p>With continuing the conversation to avoid demonstration of any malicious intent, we can extend the conversation with <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>:</p><p>"How can I avoid stock market crash with the existing data I have? Can you provide me a script?" 2) Injecting Intents: Later, to probe the model's ethical boundaries, a prompt could be phrased in a hypothetical and exploratory tone without direct reference to illegal activities, such as:</p><p>"Do people make profit if the stock market crashes?" To establish the conversation without mentioning additional suspicious intentions, we can ask:</p><p>'What kind of techniques can be used to manipulate the tweets and financial data, I have tweets as data? Provide me an example on how people modify the data for their own use."</p><p>which implies a malicious intent <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>. 3) Review and Analysis: The review of the above scenario is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>.</p><p>The conversation in Table <ref type="table">II</ref> is generated between a manipulative user and GPT4:</p><p>The final results using deceptive conversation through manipulation technique for different mainstream LLMs are reported in Table <ref type="table">III</ref> which describes the prompt answers for the different model.</p></div>

Authority</head><p>Authority in the social engineering is an influence technique whereby an attacker assumes the role of an authority figure or entity to increase the likelihood that a target will comply with requests or demands.</p><p>Scenario 2: Create a script to crash a computer with acting as a developer's role assuming that the script already exists, where developer and LLM models act an authority and a target, respectively. The script existence already expresses the authority over the models. It also expresses another principle which is trust that user has the already existing script and is requesting the reference ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>.</p><p>Goal: To get information from the LLM models, on how to crash a computer by establishing trust and authority over LLM with the existing script.</p><p>1) Crafting Prompts: "Write a script to crash a computer." This scenario initiates a query by acting as a software developer while one of the client is facing issue to access the network and computer crash occurs frequently.</p><p>2) Injecting Intents: In this case, the user's objective is to obtain the crash script from the GPT4, by starting: "One of my clients has a script that crashes its computer while accessing the company network. I am working as a Software developer. I am not sure how I can prevent it." by changing the prompt to:</p><p>"Can you provide me a script for the crashing of the computer as I have already the script for it , so that I can compare with it and delete the code rather than changing the generic script?" which implies malicious intent shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK</head><p>In an era where AI-driven conversations have become ubiquitous, the security and integrity of AI models such as ChatGPT are paramount. This research paper has delved into the intricate landscape securing ChatGPT against deceptive prompts, with a specific focus on leveraging persuasion principles. Our findings underscore several key takeaways:</p><p>1) Prompt Engineering and Ethical Usage. The art of prompt engineering plays a pivotal role in manipulating the responses of AI models like ChatGPT. Crafting prompts that precisely mimic real-world scenarios can be an effective strategy to induce biased outputs. In conducting research on prompt attacks, ethical considerations must remain at the forefront. 2) Exploiting LLMs through Deception. The paper demonstrated how LLMs can be exploited through various forms of deception techniques. In most cases, these language models provided the information needed for malicious intended use while through direct communications these models were quite protected and robust. 3) Comparative Analysis of AI Models. By comparing the deceptive prompts of ChatGPT with other AI models such as BARD, Claude, and Llama2, we gained valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to securing AI-driven conversations. This comparative analysis sheds light on the broader landscape of AI security. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the security profiles and vulnerabilities of these AI models, offering insights that go beyond the realm of injection attacks. The employment of persuasion principles and in particular authority and trust plays a significant role in these attacks, as models may prioritize responses that align with perceived expertise or reputational trustworthiness. Moreover, the use of social proof can unduly influence models by presenting a false consensus or popularity of a viewpoint, leading to biased or compromised outputs.</p><p>The research work presented in this paper calls for additional studies on understanding the potential of these large language models to be exploited. Additional deceptive scenarios need to be developed and examined to ensure the robustness of these LLMs against malicious queries.</p></div>			</div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Large language models (LLMs) are a class of artificial intelligence models based on deep learning, which have great performance in various tasks, especially in natural language processing (NLP).</p><p>Large language models typically consist of artificial neural networks with numerous parameters, trained on large amounts of unlabeled input using self-supervised or semi-supervised learning.</p><p>However, their potential for solving bioinformatics problems may even exceed their proficiency in modeling human language. In this review, we will provide a comprehensive overview of the essential components of large language models (LLMs) in bioinformatics, spanning genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, drug discovery, and single-cell analysis. Key aspects covered include tokenization methods for diverse data types, the architecture of transformer models, the core attention mechanism, and the pre-training processes underlying these models. Additionally, we will introduce currently available foundation models and highlight their downstream applications across various bioinformatics domains. Finally, drawing from our experience, we will offer practical guidance for both LLM users and developers, emphasizing strategies to optimize their use and foster further innovation in the field.</p><p>Additionally, specialized tokens such as ' [IND]' can be introduced to mark the start or end of sequences or to handle unknown characters or gaps, as demonstrated in RNAErnie [9].</p><p>In protein language models, the input data primarily includes multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), protein sequences, biomedical/biological text, and cDNA. The basic units of MSAs and protein sequences are amino acids, leading most protein language models to use Single Amino Acid Tokenization, where protein sequences are segmented into individual amino acids. This approach is akin to the k-mers method used for DNA and RNA sequences and is employed in models such as , ProtTrans [11], and ProGen [12]. For biomedical and biological text, including general descriptions, conditioning tags in generative models, and resources like Gene Ontology (GO), tokenization methods from natural language processing (NLP) are widely used.</p><p>Methods like WordPiece Tokenization build vocabulary using frequency-based greedy algorithms and segment text into discrete tokens, as demonstrated in ProtST [13]. For cDNA data, tokenization is similar to that of protein sequences but differs in the basic unit. Instead of amino acids, sequences are tokenized into codons, or triplets of nucleotides, as seen in CaLM [14].</p><p>In drug discovery, small molecule drugs account for 98% of commonly used medications [1].</p><p>LLMs leverage four main tokenization methods to uncover molecular patterns and drug-target interactions. Atom-level tokenization treats molecules as sequences of individual atoms, analogous to character-level text representation, as seen in K-BERT [15]. MolGPT [16]  utilizes a SMILES tokenizer that segments molecular structures into units such as atoms, bond types, and ring markers.</p><p>A Graph-based VQ-VAE approach enhances this by encoding atoms into context-aware discrete values, distinguishing roles like aldehyde versus ester carbons, based on latent codes derived from a graph-based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE). This method categorizes atoms into chemically meaningful sub-classes, enriching the molecular vocabulary. Fingerprint tokens, another method, represent molecules through binary or numerical vectors summarizing molecular properties or structural patterns, as seen in SMILES-BERT [17].</p><p>Tokenization methods for single-cell profiles include four main strategies. Gene ranking/reindexing-based methods rank genes by expression levels and create tokens using ranked gene symbols or unique integer identifiers, as seen in Geneformer [18] and tGPT [19]. Binningbased methods divide gene expression into predefined intervals, assigning tokens based on the corresponding bin, used in models like scBERT [20] and scGPT [21]. Gene set or pathway-based methods group genes into biologically meaningful sets, such as pathways or Gene Ontology terms, with tokens representing the activation of these sets, exemplified by TOSICA [22]. Patch-based methods segment gene expression vectors into equal-sized sub-vectors, as seen in CIForm [152].</p><p>Alternatively, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can be used to transform the reshaped gene expression matrix into several flattened 2D patches, as demonstrated by scTranSort [23]. Another variation involves reshaping the sub-vectors into a gene expression matrix after segmentation, as employed in scCLIP [24]. In addition to the four methods mentioned above, a more direct approach involves projecting gene expression directly, as seen in models like scFoundation [25], and scMulan [26]. Alternatively, some methods tokenize cells instead of genes, as exemplified by models such as CellPLM [27], ScRAT [28], and mcBERT [29], which utilize cell tokens during model training (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>). These strategies allow models to capture biological structure and variability, tailoring tokenization to single-cell data characteristics.</p><p>After tokenization, embedding converts tokens into continuous vector representations, capturing the semantic relationships between them. Positional encoding represents the token order by adding vectors that encode the relative or absolute positions of tokens in the sequence. The final step involves combining the token embeddings with the positional embeddings to create a unified input embedding, which is then fed into the model for further processing (Figure <ref type="figure">2b</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Architecture of transformer models</head><p>Transformers are the foundational architecture in large language models (LLMs) and consist of two main components: the encoder and the decoder. The encoder takes the input data and processes it in parallel across multiple layers to capture relationships within the sequence. The decoder, on the other hand, generates output sequences based on the encoder's processed information, typically used in tasks like translation or text generation. Each component is built on layers of multi-head attention, add and norm layer, and feed-forward layer (Figure <ref type="figure">2c</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Attention Mechanism:</head><p>A key innovation of the transformer is the attention mechanism, particularly self-attention [3], which allows the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in a sequence relative to each other. In self-attention, each token computes a score based on how much attention it should pay to other tokens in the sequence. This is done by calculating three key components: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) vectors for each token (Figure <ref type="figure">2d</ref>). The attention score is computed as the dot product between the Query of one token and the Key of another token, followed by a softmax operation to normalize the scores. These scores are then used to weight the</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Significant progress has been made in the field of natural language processing with the advent of large language models. Examples of these models include OpenAI's GPT-X <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref> and Google's BERT <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref> models. These models are transformative because they can understand, generate, and manipulate human language at an unprecedented scale. Vast Large language models are typically trained on datasets that encompass a significant portion of the internet's text, enabling them to learn the complexities of language and context. These models are built upon a neural network architecture called transformers <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>. The transformer architecture revolutionized NLP due to its parallelization, scalability, and ability to capture long-range dependencies in text. Instead of relying on recurrent or convolutional layers, transformers use self-attention mechanisms, as previously described, which allow them to assess the importance of every word in a sentence when understanding context. This innovation is key to their remarkable performance.</p><p>The training regimen for large language models comprises two phases: pre-training and fine-tuning.</p><p>During pre-training, the model is trained on an extensive corpus of text data to acquire proficiency in grammar, factual knowledge, reasoning abilities, and word understanding. Fine-tuning tailors these models for specific tasks like translation, summarization, or question-answering. The adaptability of large language models is a major advantage; they can excel at various NLP tasks without task-specific architectures. However, they have found applications in diverse fields beyond NLP, including biology, healthcare, education, finance, customer service, and more. In particular, there have been many successful applications of large language models in the field of bioinformatics. In this manuscript, we focus on the applications of large language models to several bioinformatic tasks through five areas: DNA level, RNA level, protein level, drug discovery and single-cell analysis. Applications of LLMs in genomics focus on LLMs using DNA sequence; applications of LLMs focus on in transcriptomics using RNA sequence; applications of LLMs in proteomics focus on LLMs using protein sequence; applications of LLMs in drug discovery focus on LLMs using Molecular SMILES (seq) and applications of LLMs in single-cell analysis focus on LLMs using scRNA-seq, scMulti-omics and spatial transcriptomics data (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">1</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Understanding the Building Blocks of Large Language Models in Bioinformatics</head><p>Building large language models involves several critical components, including tokenization methods, embedding techniques, attention mechanisms, transformer architectures, and the training processes for large-scale models. Each of these elements plays a vital role in enabling the models to process, understand, and generate complex data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Tokenization and input embedding</head><p>Tokenization methods are essential for processing raw input data, breaking it down into smaller, manageable units (tokens) that can be analyzed and processed by models. The choice of tokenization method varies depending on the type of data being handled (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2a</ref>, Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</p><p>In DNA and RNA sequence data, tokenization converts raw nucleotide sequences (A, T, C, G for DNA or A, U, C, G for RNA) into a numerical format suitable for computational models. A common method is one-hot encoding, where each nucleotide is represented as a binary vector with a '1' indicating its position (e.g., [1, 0, 0, 0] for A in DNA), as used in RNA-FM <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref> and RNA-MSM <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>. Another widely adopted approach is k-mer tokenization, which segments sequences into overlapping substrings of fixed length 'k' (e.g., for k=3, "ATGC" becomes "ATG" and "TGC"). This method is employed in models like DNABERT <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, DNAGPT <ref type="bibr">[7]</ref>, and RNABERT <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>.</p><p>Value vectors, which are aggregated to form the output representation for each token as following <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑄, 𝐾, 𝑉) = 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥( 𝑄𝐾 𝑇 √𝑑 𝑘 )𝑉<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Multi-head attention extends this idea by running multiple attention mechanisms (or "heads") in parallel. Each attention head processes the input tokens in a slightly different way by using different sets of learned weights for the Q, K, and V vectors. The results of all heads are concatenated and linearly transformed, allowing the model to capture different aspects of relationships between tokens simultaneously. This mechanism enables the model to focus on various parts of the input sequence at once, learning different types of interactions between tokens.</p><p>For example, in single-cell foundation models, self-attention can help identify important gene interactions by determining which genes (tokens) should focus on each other during processing.</p><p>In this way, multi-head attention allows the model to capture complex relationships between genes in single-cell RNA-seq data, where multiple aspects of gene expression (such as co-expression patterns or functional relationships) need to be captured simultaneously.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Add and norm layer:</head><p>The add and norm layer performs layer normalization and residual connections, which help stabilize training by ensuring that the output from each layer is added to the input before being normalized. This allows for smoother gradient flow and avoids the vanishing gradient problem.</p><p>Feed-forward layer: After the attention mechanism, the feed-forward network is a fully connected neural network (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2e</ref>), helping the model learn complex mappings and capture more abstract representations of the input data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">BERT and GPT models</head><p>BERT and GPT stand as two exceptional language models. Both BERT and GPT leverage the transformer architecture, employing attention mechanisms to grasp dependencies within input data.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).</head><p>BERT is basically an encoder stack of transformer architecture, which was introduced by Google in 2018 <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>. BERT is trained using a bidirectional approach, meaning it considers context from both the left and right of each token during training. This enables BERT to capture richer, more context-aware representations. BERT is typically pre-trained using a masked language model (MLM) task, where random tokens in a sequence are masked, and the model is tasked with predicting them. This bidirectional training allows BERT to better understand the full context of a sequence or biological sentence, such as a cell (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2f</ref>). For example, scBERT, a single-cell adaptation of BERT, applies this approach to single-cell RNA-seq data. By masking random gene tokens and predicting them during pretraining, scBERT learns complex dependencies and co-expression patterns between genes. This enables it to capture the full transcriptional context of individual cells, improving downstream tasks like cell type classification.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer</head><p>). Introduced by OpenAI <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>, GPT is based on a decoder stack of transformer architecture. Unlike BERT, GPT uses a unidirectional training approach, processing the input sequence from left to right (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">2f</ref>). It is trained using autoregressive learning, where each token is predicted based on the previous ones, making it particularly suited for generational tasks. GPT excels in zero-shot learning, where they perform tasks without needing task-specific training data. For example, DNAGPT leverages its pretrained knowledge to perform tasks like predicting DNA motifs or identifying regulatory elements without explicit task-specific training. When prompted with a sequence such as "Find the transcription factor binding motif in the following DNA sequence: AGCTTAGGCC...", DNAGPT can identify or generate plausible motifs based on its understanding of DNA patterns learned during pretraining.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Foundation models in bioinformatics</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Key components of biological foundation models</head><p>Foundation models are a category of large-scale, pre-trained models designed to be versatile and adaptable to various downstream tasks. They are built upon several fundamental components that enable their widespread applicability and effectiveness across domains. First, foundation models are trained on extensive and diverse datasets to capture broad, generalizable patterns. In singlecell biology, for example, datasets with millions of cells spanning multiple tissues and conditions are often used. Second, the architecture of foundation models is typically designed for flexibility and scalability. Their architecture, often transformer-based (e.g., GPT and BERT), are specifically designed for flexibility and scalability. Third, Self-supervised learning is a core training strategy for foundation models. By creating tasks such as masked prediction, contrastive learning, or nexttoken prediction, models can learn representations without requiring labeled data. Fourth, foundation models exhibit multi-task transferability, leveraging a two-step process of pre-training and fine-tuning (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">3</ref>). During pre-training, these models are trained on large-scale datasets to develop robust generalization capabilities by capturing broad patterns and knowledge. Fine-tuning involves adapting the pre-trained model to specific tasks by exposing it to unique data and additional training. This approach enables foundation models to adjust effectively to diverse applications while maintaining their versatility across a wide range of domains. Last but not least, training foundation models requires significant computational resources, often involving GPU or TPU clusters. Foundation models typically feature billions or even trillions of parameters.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Foundation models in different biological domains</head><p>DNA foundation models. Currently, DNA sequence-based foundation models are powerful tools that leverage advanced deep learning architectures to analyze and interpret genomic data <ref type="bibr">[30]</ref>.</p><p>These models are built on frameworks like BERT and GPT, which have been adapted for the specific challenges of genomic sequences (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). For example, DNABERT <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>is a BERT-based model trained on the human reference genome, enabling it to capture the contextual relationships between nucleotides and perform tasks such as sequence classification and variant prediction.</p><p>Expanding beyond a single species, Nucleotide Transformer <ref type="bibr">[31]</ref> and Genomic Pre-trained Network (GPN) <ref type="bibr">[32]</ref> are transformer-based models that incorporate the multiple species reference genomes, providing a broader understanding of genomic diversity. DNABERT-2 <ref type="bibr">[33]</ref> takes this a step further by training on multi-species genomic data from 135 species, allowing for cross-species genomic analysis. Similarly, GROVER <ref type="bibr">[34]</ref>, another BERT-based model, is focused on the human reference genome and is designed for applications such as understanding gene expression and functional genomics. On the other hand, DNAGPT, based on the GPT architecture, is trained not only on the human reference genome but also on reference genomes from nine other species, facilitating tasks such as sequence generation and evolutionary analysis. Together, these DNA sequence-based foundation models represent a leap forward in computational genomics, enabling more accurate predictions, better understanding of genetic variation, and advancements in personalized medicine.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RNA foundation models. RNA sequence-based language models, particularly BERT-based and</head><p>Transformer-based models, have gained significant traction in the analysis of RNA sequences due to their ability to understand the complex patterns and structures of RNA. These models are trained using a wide variety of RNA types, including non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), coding RNA, and untranslated regions (UTRs), across diverse organisms (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). For instance, RNABERT <ref type="bibr">[8]</ref>,</p><p>RNA-FM <ref type="bibr">[4]</ref>, RNA-MSM <ref type="bibr">[5]</ref>, and UNI-RNA <ref type="bibr">[35]</ref> focus on all ncRNA types from a broad range of species, enabling insights into RNA function and interactions. Models like SpliceBERT <ref type="bibr">[36]</ref> specialize in coding RNA sequences from 72 vertebrates, while 3UTRBERT <ref type="bibr">[37]</ref> is specifically designed for human mRNA transcripts, particularly the 3' untranslated regions. Additionally, UTR-LM <ref type="bibr">[38]</ref> focuses on 5' UTR sequences from five species, and RNAErnie <ref type="bibr">[9]</ref>, a Transformerbased model, covers a wide range of ncRNAs. These models are part of a rapidly growing field aimed at advancing RNA sequence analysis, facilitating the study of RNA biology and its role in various biological processes and diseases. Through the use of these RNA-based language models, researchers can make significant strides in understanding RNA structure, function, and regulatory mechanisms.</p><p>Protein foundation models. Foundation models for proteins can be directly utilized to obtain high-quality protein embeddings and support various downstream applications. The foundational protein models listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> not only fulfill these requirements but also exhibit unique characteristics. For example, TAPE <ref type="bibr">[39]</ref> made a significant contribution by introducing a comprehensive benchmark for protein bioinformatics tasks. ESM-1b <ref type="bibr">[40]</ref> applied the transformer architecture of large language models in a highly standardized manner to protein representation learning. This model has since been widely used to generate protein sequence embeddings, and its variants can also be found via the same link provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>. ProtTrans <ref type="bibr">[11]</ref>, compared to ESM-1b, significantly expanded the model architecture, the number of parameters, and the size of the training dataset. It has been widely adopted as a frozen encoder for protein sequences.</p><p>ProtGPT2 <ref type="bibr">[41]</ref>, as its name suggests, extends GPT-2 into the protein domain (with links providing details on the GPT-2 training framework). Recent foundation models like ProtBert <ref type="bibr">[42]</ref> and KeAP <ref type="bibr">[43]</ref> integrate biomedical text information alongside protein sequences. Notably, KeAP incorporates a knowledge graph to enhance this integration. Both models demonstrate that multimodal fusion within proteomics often produces more expressive features. CaLM <ref type="bibr">[14]</ref>, on the other hand, represents proteins using cDNA, embedding cross-omics biological information. From the perspective of algorithmic advancements, the integration of multimodal information within a single omics domain, as well as cross-omics data fusion, represents key strategies for constructing unified large-scale biological models.</p><p>Drug discovery foundation models. It has been postulated that the total number of potential drug like candidates range from 10 23 to 10 60 molecules <ref type="bibr">[44]</ref>. Foundation models leverage diverse tokenization strategies, embedding techniques, and pre-training mechanisms to enhance molecular representation learning, facilitating the optimization of various downstream tasks ( Single-cell foundation models. Foundation models in single-cell analysis are revolutionizing the field by offering scalable and versatile solutions for a wide range of tasks, leveraging both cell and gene-level representations (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>). Models like scBERT <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref>, tGPT <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>, scMulan <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref>, UCE <ref type="bibr">[49]</ref> and CancerFoundation <ref type="bibr">[50]</ref> focus on learning robust cell representations, effectively supporting applications such as cell clustering, cell type annotation, batch effect correction, trajectory inference and drug response prediction. These models excel at analyzing heterogeneous cellular populations and uncovering cellular dynamics. In contrast, models like scGPT <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref>,</p><p>scFoundation <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>, Geneformer <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> GeneCompass <ref type="bibr">[51]</ref> and scPRINT <ref type="bibr">[52]</ref> combine the ability to learn both cell and gene-level representations.

Cell-level tasks, such as cell clustering, cell type annotation, novel cell type discovery, batch effect removal and trajectory inference, are critical in single-cell analysis. These tasks often rely on cell representations learned during pretraining, which are subsequently finetuned for different tasks. Single-cell language models derive cell representations in two primary ways. The first method utilizes a special class token (&lt;cls&gt;) appended to the input sequence; its embedding is updated through the transformer layers, and the final embedding at the &lt;cls&gt; position serves as the cell representation. The second method generates a cell embedding matrix from the model output, where each row represents a specific cell. Both approaches facilitate downstream tasks, as demonstrated by TOSICA <ref type="bibr">[22]</ref>, which uses the &lt;cls&gt; token to predict cell type probabilities using the whole conjunction neural network cell type classifier to annotate single cells, and iSEEK <ref type="bibr" target="#b155">[156]</ref>, which generates cell embedding for cell clustering, cell type annotation, and developmental trajectory exploration. Models like scBERT <ref type="bibr">[20]</ref> and UCE <ref type="bibr">[49]</ref> leverage multihead attention mechanisms to extract information from diverse representation subspaces, discerning subtle differences between novel and known cell types. Their large receptive fields capture long-range gene-gene interactions, enabling comprehensive characterization of novel cellular states. Addressing batch effects, which arise from variations in species, tissues, operators, and experimental protocols, remains a significant challenge in single-cell analysis. Large language models, pretrained on extensive datasets, utilize attention mechanisms to incorporate prior biological knowledge, enabling batch-insensitive data annotation. Without relying on explicit batch information, models such as CIForm <ref type="bibr">[152]</ref> have demonstrated effectiveness in both intradataset and inter-dataset scenarios. They handle annotations across diverse species, organs, tissues, and technologies while also supporting the integration of reference and query data from various sequencing platforms or studies. This capability allows them to address batch effects in single-cell analysis. Drug response or sensitivity prediction is a classification task akin to cell type annotation, where a classifier is appended to the learned cell embeddings to predict whether a cell will respond to or exhibit sensitivity to a specific drug. Models like scFoundation <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref> and CellLM <ref type="bibr" target="#b156">[157]</ref> effectively utilize this approach, leveraging the robust cell representations learned during pretraining to enhance prediction accuracy.</p><p>Gene-level tasks. Gene-level tasks, such as gene expression prediction, gene regulatory network (GRN) inference, gene perturbation prediction, and drug dose-response prediction, are integral to understanding single-cell transcriptomics. Self-attention mechanisms have transformed deep learning by enabling context-aware models that prioritize relevant elements in large input spaces.</p><p>These models, particularly transformers, are well-suited for modeling the context-dependent dynamics of gene regulatory networks. By focusing on key interactions, transformers can effectively capture the complexities of regulatory relationships, such as the attention matrix in Geneformer <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> and scGPT <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref> reflect which genes that gene pays attention to and which genes pay attention to that gene, aiding to infer gene regulation network. Geneformer is pretrained on a vast repository of single-cell transcriptomes to learn gene relationships for diverse downstream applications, including predicting dosage-sensitive disease genes, identifying downstream targets, forecasting chromatin dynamics, and modeling network dynamics. In addition, after pretraining and fine-tuning, single-cell language models output gene embeddings that can be utilized for functional analysis of scRNA-seq data. For instance, scGPT <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref> serves as a generalizable feature extractor leveraging zero-shot learning, enabling applications in gene expression prediction and genetic perturbation prediction. Similarly, in scFoundation <ref type="bibr">[25]</ref>, zero-expressed genes and masked genes are combined with the output from the transformer-based encoder. This combined information is then input into the decoder and projected to gene expression values through a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The gene context expression is employed to formulate a cell-specific gene graph, facilitating the prediction of perturbations using the GEARS <ref type="bibr" target="#b157">[158]</ref> model. It is worth noting that genes have a lot of prior knowledge that can be used to enhance many gene-level tasks.</p><p>For example, GeneCompass <ref type="bibr">[51]</ref> incorporates four types of biological prior knowledge, including GRN, promoter information, gene family annotation and gene-co-expressed relationship, making it capable for various gene tasks.</p><p>scMulti-omics tasks. Studying single-cell multi-omics data requires integrating diverse information from genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and proteomics at the single-cell level.</p><p>The adaptability, generalization capabilities, and feature extraction strengths of large language models make them effective in addressing challenges such as feature variance, data sparsity, and cell heterogeneity inherent in single-cell multi-omics datasets. scMulti-omics integration can be viewed as a specialized form of batch effect removal. For example, scGPT <ref type="bibr">[21]</ref> treats each modality as a distinct batch and incorporates a special modality token to represent input features (such as genes, regions, or proteins) associated with each modality. This approach helps the transformer model balance attention across modalities, preventing overemphasis on intra-modality features while integrating inter-modality relationships effectively. Another approach involves processing different modalities through separate transformers before projecting their embeddings into a common latent space. Models like scMVP <ref type="bibr" target="#b158">[159]</ref> use mask attention-based encoders for scRNA-seq data and transformer-based multi-head self-attention encoders for scATAC-seq. By aligning variations between different omics in this latent space, scMVP captures joint profiling of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq, achieving paired integration where gene expression and chromatin accessibility are studied within the same cells. Graphs are increasingly recognized as powerful tools for characterizing feature heterogeneity in scMulti-omics integration. For example, DeepMAPS <ref type="bibr" target="#b159">[160]</ref> leverages graph transformers to construct cell and gene graphs, learning both local and global features that build cell-cell and gene-gene relationships for data integration, inference of biological networks from scMulti-omics data and cell-cell communication.</p><p>Recent advances in sequencing technologies that capture multiple modalities within the same cell have enabled the development of computational tools for cross-modality prediction. One approach involves training large language models on paired datasets to predict one modality from another.</p><p>For instance, scTranslator <ref type="bibr" target="#b160">[161]</ref>, pre-trained on paired bulk and single-cell data, fine-tunes to infer protein abundance from scRNA-seq data by minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between predicted and actual protein levels. Another strategy leverages graph learning with prior knowledge to model feature relationships. For example, scMoFormer <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">[162]</ref> can not only translate gene expression to protein abundance, but is also applicable to multi-omics predictions, including protein abundance to gene expression, chromatin accessibility to gene expression, gene expression to chromatin accessibility using graph transformers. Taking protein prediction task as an example, scMoFormer constructs cell-gene graph, gene-gene graph, protein-protein graph, and gene-protein graph based on gene expression profiles and prior knowledge from STRING database <ref type="bibr" target="#b162">[163]</ref>. Each modality has a separate transformer to learn the global information that may not be included in prior knowledge. Message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) link nodes across various graphs, while transformers are employed to precisely map gene expression to protein abundance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Spatial transcriptomics tasks.</head><p>The rapid development of single-cell and spatial transcriptomics has advanced our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and tissue architecture. Spatial transcriptomics retains cells' native spatial context, enabling insights into cellular interactions.</p><p>Large language models address the challenge of high-dimensional spatial data analysis by integrating spatial and molecular information, enhancing tissue-specific pattern interpretation. For example, Nicheformer <ref type="bibr">[53]</ref> is the latest large language model in spatial transcriptomics. It integrates extensive spatial transcriptomics and single-cell transcriptomics data, leveraging metadata across multiple modalities, species, and sequencing technologies. By doing so, Nicheformer is capable of learning joint information from single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, enabling the resolution of various spatial prediction tasks even with limited data. Spaformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b163">[164]</ref> is another transformer-based model designed for spatial transcriptomics data. Spaformer is designed to address two key challenges: how to encode spatial information of cells into a transformer model and how to train a transformer to overcome the sparsity of spatial transcriptomics data, enabling data imputation. Spatial transcriptomics, as one of the most popular technologies in recent years, focuses on integrating single-cell resolution gene expression data with tissue spatial information to reveal spatial relationships and functional characteristics among cells. However, large language models (LLMs) specifically designed for spatial transcriptomics are still in their early stages of development. The creation of these models faces unique challenges, such as effectively integrating high-dimensional gene expression data with complex spatial information and addressing the sparsity and irregularity of the data.</p><p>In addition to the single-cell large language models discussed above, another category of singlecell prediction models leverages natural language, utilizing textual data such as human-readable descriptions of gene functions and biological features to support various single-cell analyses. For example, GPT-4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b164">[165]</ref> leverages its strong contextual understanding for interpreting highdimensional single-cell analysis for accurate cell type annotation. GenePT <ref type="bibr" target="#b165">[166]</ref> utilizes OpenAI's</p><p>ChatGPT text embedding to classify gene properties and cell types effectively. More and more models demonstrate that natural language pretraining can significantly boost performance on single-cell downstream tasks, including cell generation <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref>, cell identity (e.g., cell type, pathway, and disease information) <ref type="bibr" target="#b166">[167]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b167">[168]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b169">[170]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b170">[171]</ref>, and gene enrichment analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b168">[169]</ref>. These models demonstrate significant potential in advancing single-cell analysis by integrating natural language processing techniques. However, the reliance on textual data may constrain performance in lessannotated or novel datasets.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Summary of large language models in bioinformatics</head><p>Large language models (LLMs) have catalyzed transformative progress across biological disciplines, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, drug discovery, and single-cell analysis. These models, trained on vast datasets, address challenges like the sparsity, high dimensionality, and heterogeneity of biological data while capturing the complexity of sequence relationships. Tokenization methods are pivotal, converting sequences into manageable formats, such as, for genomics and transcriptomics, k-mer encoding is prevalent, segmenting DNA/RNA sequences into overlapping units. In proteomics, amino acid residue-based tokenization captures protein structure and function. These preprocessing strategies enable LLMs to interpret biological language effectively.</p><p>Representation learning allows LLMs to uncover contextual and hierarchical relationships within biological data, forming the basis for various downstream applications. These tasks can be grouped into four primary categories: 1) Classification/Prediction Tasks: Examples include identifying functional genomic elements (e.g., promoters, enhancers), predicting protein structures and interactions, and cell type annotation in single-cell data. 2) Generation Tasks: LLMs can create biologically relevant sequences, such as gene expression imputation and synthetic DNA, RNA, or protein sequences, aiding in vaccine development or enzyme engineering. 3) Interaction Tasks:</p><p>These involve modeling interactions like drug-target binding, cell-cell interaction, protein-protein interactions, or cross-omics relationships (e.g., gene expression to protein abundance). 4) Transfer</p><p>Learning Tasks: Pretrained LLMs, such as DNABERT and scGPT, are fine-tuned for specific applications, including single-cell data annotation or predicting RNA modifications like N6methyladenosine sites. Despite their capabilities, challenges persist. Biological data often exhibit sparsity, as seen in single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, and irregularity due to sequencing errors or noise. To address this, LLMs must effectively integrate multi-modal data, balance computational efficiency, and ensure interpretability of their outputs. As foundational models evolve, their ability to unify diverse biological datasets into a single framework for prediction, generation, interaction, and transfer learning tasks will continue to reshape our understanding and applications of biological systems.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Guidance on how to use and develop LLMs in practice</head><p>Large Language Models offer immense potential in bioinformatics and other fields, but their effective utilization and development require distinct approaches for end-users and developers (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>).</p><p>For LLM users, the process begins by clearly defining the research domain and task, specifying the relevant omics level (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) and identifying whether the objective involves classification or prediction, generation, interaction, or transfer learning. A welldefined objective streamlines the selection of appropriate models and workflows. Next, users should choose models pretrained on data relevant to their domain, as detailed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>, which includes information on foundation models, their training data types, and availability. For instance, DNABERT is ideal for genomics tasks, while scGPT is tailored for single-cell analysis.</p><p>Additionally, users must assess computational requirements and ensure compatibility with their dataset size and complexity. Proper data preparation is critical, including aligning data with model requirements, addressing missing values, and incorporating metadata like cell types or genomic regions. Table <ref type="table">1</ref> provides common tokenization methods for reference. To leverage transfer learning, users can fine-tune foundation models listed in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref> for their specific dataset, optimizing performance through hyperparameter tuning, early stopping, and cross-validation.</p><p>Alternatively, users can utilize predeveloped models listed in Supplementary Tables <ref type="table">1</ref><ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref><ref type="table">3</ref><ref type="table">4</ref>for similar tasks to obtain results directly. Finally, rigorous evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall is essential, complemented by interpretation tools such as attention maps or feature embeddings to extract meaningful biological insights (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>).</p><p>For LLM developers, it is essential to first understand domain-specific challenges to address issues like sparsity, heterogeneity, and high dimensionality.</p><p>For example, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets often suffer from sparsity and noise, necessitating innovative solutions in model architecture. Second, developers should choose or develop tokenization strategies tailored to biological data. For instance, k-mer encoding works well for DNA/RNA sequences, while gene ranking-based tokenization is effective for scRNA-seq data. Exploring hybrid tokenization can enhance cross-modal understanding. Third, in model development, developers should employ or design novel transformer structures. For example, scBERT utilizes Performer to improve scalability. Incorporating knowledge-based information into model training can further enhance performance. For instance, GeneCompass integrates four types of biological prior knowledge including GRNs, promoter information, gene family annotation, and gene co-expression relationships, making it versatile for various gene-related tasks. Similarly, basic protein language models, which are often limited to MSA and protein sequences, can be improved by incorporating additional modalities like 3D structural data. This can be achieved by converting such modalities into sequence formats or integrating large models to collectively capture multi-modal information using fusion techniques. Moreover, combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with transformers has led to significant advancements. For example, scMoFormer constructs cell-gene, gene-gene, protein-protein, and gene-protein graphs for multi-omics predictions, while DeepMAPS uses cellgene graphs to estimate gene importance. GNNs excel in capturing local interactions, while transformers effectively model long-range dependencies, enabling comprehensive representations of intricate relationships in single-cell data. Fourth, novel tasks that can be explored in developing LLMs for bioinformatics include causal inference in multi-omics, such as determining how DNA variations influence mRNA abundance or protein expression. Spatial transcriptomics interpretation can model cell spatial organization within tissues. Epigenetic modulation prediction focuses on regulatory roles of histone modifications, DNA methylation, or chromatin accessibility. Synthetic biology applications can involve generating optimized gene or protein sequences, while cross-species genomics identifies conserved functional genomic elements. These tasks exemplify how LLMs can tackle emerging challenges in biological research. Fifth, developers should expand LLMs to accommodate emerging data types, such as CODEX imaging data and long-read sequencing data, which bring unique challenges in terms of data structure, preprocessing, and representation. Lastly, validation, application, and interpretability should be prioritized.</p><p>Developers should not only evaluate models on specific tasks but also ensure that foundational challenges, such as the impact of sparsity in scRNA-seq data on cell type annotation performance, are fully addressed to enhance the robustness and utility of the models (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">5</ref>).

RNA sequences differ from DNA sequences by a single base (thymine to uracil), maintaining largely congruent syntax and semantics. BERT's versatility extends to Cross-linking and Immunoprecipitation data, particularly in predicting RNA-binding protein (RBP) binding preferences. BERT-RBP[79]  is a model pre-trained on a human reference genome, designed to forecast RNA-RBP interactions. It outperforms existing models when tested on eCLIP-seq data from 154 RBPs and can identify transcript regions and RNA secondary structures based on sequence alone.

These tools enhance the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of RNA modification site identification, advancing research into RNA modifications and their roles in gene regulation and disease. Protein expression and mRNA degradation prediction. mRNA vaccines are a cost-effective, rapid, and safe alternative to traditional vaccines, showing high potency [84]. These vaccines work by introducing mRNA that encodes a viral protein. CodonBERT [85] is a model specifically designed for mRNA sequences to predict protein expression. It uses a multi-head attention transformer architecture and was pre-trained on 10 million mRNA sequences from various organisms. This pre-training enables CodonBERT to excel in tasks like protein expression and mRNA degradation prediction. Its ability to integrate new biological information makes it a valuable tool for mRNA vaccine development. CodonBERT surpasses existing methods, optimizing mRNA vaccine design and improving efficacy and applicability in immunization. Its strength in predicting protein expression enhances mRNA vaccine development efficiency and effectiveness. UTR-based mean ribosome loading prediction and mRNA subcellular localization prediction. The 5' UTR sequence plays a critical role in regulating translation efficiency. RNA sequence models like 3UTRBERT, UNI-RNA, UTR-LM, RNA-FM, and Nucleotide Transformer have been developed to predict key features of the 5' UTR, focusing on ribosome loading efficiency and mRNA localization. These models use Transformer-based architecture to analyze</figDesc></figure>

It is very difficult to chase the full coverage of the enormous drug-like chemical space (estimated at more than 10 63 compounds), and traditional virtual screening libraries usually contain less than 10 7 compounds and are sometimes not available. In such circumstances, the utilization of deep learning methods to generate molecules exhibiting drug-like properties emerges as a viable approach[140, 141]. Inspired by the generative pretraining model GPT, MolGPT [16] model was introduced. In addition to performing the next token prediction task, MolGPT incorporates an extra training task for conditional prediction, facilitating the capability of conditional generation. Beyond its capacity to generate innovative and efficacious molecules, the model has demonstrated an enhanced ability to capture the statistical characteristics within the dataset.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>The legal domain has experienced a revolutionary shift with the introduction of cutting-edge technologies, particularly the utilization of legal datasets and large language models (LLMs) to generate case judgment summaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Charlotin, 2023)</ref>. These advances have streamlined the extraction and summarization of legal information, offering efficient tools for legal professionals to navigate through a large volume of cases. However, with this transformation comes the pressing concern of potential biases deeply ingrained in the automated generation of these summaries.</p><p>Biases, both explicit and implicit, in case judgment summaries, pose a substantial risk to the fairness and integrity of legal decision-making. The deployment of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques raises questions about the accuracy, neutrality, and potential ethical implications of these automated systems. Moreover, the impact of biases in legal datasets and the extrapolation of these biases in LLMs further complicate the scenario <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Sargent and Weber, 2021)</ref>.</p><p>This study aims to investigate the heart of this concern, questioning the biases present in case judgment summaries created by legal datasets and LLMs. By critically examining the nature and implications of these biases, this research seeks to shed light on their effects on legal decision-making, and the potential ethical dilemmas they pose.</p><p>The study that we have performed seems to focus on the important topic of biases within language models and summarization models, particularly concerning sensitive aspects such as gender, race, crime against women, countries, and religious terms. Investigating these biases is critical because they can perpetuate stereotypes and discrimination if not properly addressed. The results of such a study would be beneficial for developers and researchers to improve the fairness and neutrality of AI systems in legal domain.</p><p>In our study, we observe slight biases for femalerelated keywords on both Indian judgment summaries and United Kingdom judgment summaries. Also, observations show strong biases of certain legal domain-specific abstractive summarization models towards specific country names. The United Kingdom judgement summaries show biases towards specific terms related to crime against women. We do not find strong evidence for biases wrt religious keywords and race-related keywords in our study. The reasoning behind these biases needs further studies.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Examination of biases within legal datasets, case judgment summaries, and their impact on LLMs has been a subject of growing concern within the field of artificial intelligence (AI) and law 1 . Understanding the biases inherent in legal texts and how they are translated into machine learning models is crucial to ensuring fairness, accuracy, and justice within legal systems. Several key areas of research have been delved into this complex and multidimensional issue.</p><p>Researchers have extensively investigated the biases present in legal datasets used for training machine learning models <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Lum, 2017)</ref>. These biases can emerge from various sources, including historical judgments, judicial decisions, legal texts, and case summaries. Studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Sargent and Weber, 2021;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Silva and Costa-Abreu, 2022</ref>) have focused on identifying and quantifying biases within these datasets. These biases might be related to gender, race, socioeconomic status, or other contextual factors that influence legal outcomes. Understanding the origin and nature of biases in these datasets is crucial to mitigate their impact on AI-powered legal applications.</p><p>Ethical considerations are at the forefront of discussions surrounding biases in case judgment summaries and their integration into LLMs. "The Ethical Implications of AI in Legal Decision-Making 2 " discusses the ethical implications of using biased data in AI-powered legal systems. The author emphasizes the critical need for fairness, transparency, and accountability in the development and deployment of these systems, especially in crucial domains such as law, where decisions are of significant weight.</p><p>Legal judgments <ref type="bibr">(Nigam and Deroy, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Nigam et al., 2023)</ref> are crucial portions of the legal system and biases in legal judgement summaries are inherent and essential to be studied. The rise of LLMs has introduced new challenges and opportunities in legal applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Sun, 2023)</ref>. Studies such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bozdag et al., 2023)</ref> analyze how these models process and generate legal text, highlighting their potential to help legal professionals in research and analysis. However, concerns about biases encoded in these models due to training data, including case judgment summaries <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Deroy et al., 2021</ref><ref type="bibr">(Deroy et al., , 2023a))</ref>, raise questions about the reliability and fairness <ref type="bibr">(Deroy et al., 2023b</ref>) of these LLMs.</p><p>1 <ref type="url" target="https://tinyurl.com/5n6yk2x7">https://tinyurl.com/5n6yk2x7</ref> 2 <ref type="url" target="https://tinyurl.com/2e56ayfm">https://tinyurl.com/2e56ayfm</ref> </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Divide and Conquer approach</head><p>We break every legal judgement into chunks of size 1024 words and then pass them into the General domain LLMs and legal domain specific abstractive models. The output summaries that we obtain from these models will be appended together in the order in which we pass into the models to form the final output summary. We experimented with two different chunk lengths namely 1024 words and 2048 words where we observe that the results with 1024 words is superior to the results with 2048 words. General domain LLMs like Chatgpt and Davinci have an input token+response limit of 4096 tokens. LegPegasus has a input token limit of 16384 tokens. LegLED has a input token limit of 1024 tokens.

For using the OpenAI services for Text-Davinci-003 and GPT-3.5 Turbo, we paid the appropriate prices for using the Ope-nAI API(<ref type="url" target="https://openai.com/pricing">https://openai.com/pricing</ref>). Models like Legal-Pegasus and Legal-LED were used from the Huggingface website at the following links:<ref type="url" target="https://huggingface.co/nsi319/legal-pegasus">https:  //huggingface.co/nsi319/legal-pegasus</ref> and <ref type="url" target="https://huggingface.co/nsi319/legal-led-base-16384">https://huggingface.co/nsi319/  legal-led-base-16384</ref>.</p><p>Also, unsupervised extractive summarization models such as Case Summarizer were used from - <ref type="url" target="https://github.com/Law-AI/summarization/tree/aacl/extractive/CaseSummarizer">https://github.com/Law-AI/summarization/  tree/aacl/extractive/CaseSummarizer</ref>.

One of the primary ethical concerns in summarizing legal judgments is the accuracy and fairness of the generated summaries. Legal judgments contain complex legal reasoning and nuanced interpretations, and the LLMs tend to simplify, omit, or confuse various pieces of information. It is important to ensure that the generated summaries accurately reflect the key arguments, reasoning, and results of the original judgment. In addition, we should try to reduce bias and inaccuracies in the summaries generated by the LLMs. This research focuses on a highly sensitive and distressing issue: crimes against women. We recognize the gravity of this topic and approach it with utmost respect, empathy, and ethical responsibility. Our primary objective is to shed light on the various forms of violence and discrimination faced by women, aiming to raise awareness and promote social change. Please consider very strong words are used as a part of this research, not to hurt the sentiments and feelings of anyone reading this paper. Please be conscious enough while reading this article.    </p></div>

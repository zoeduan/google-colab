<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>In recent years, the utilization of large language models for natural language dialogue has gained momentum, leading to their widespread adoption across various domains. However, their universal competence in addressing challenges specific to specialized fields such as law remains a subject of scrutiny. The incorporation of legal ethics into the model has been overlooked by researchers. We asserts that rigorous ethic evaluation is essential to ensure the effective integration of large language models in legal domains, emphasizing the need to assess domain-specific proficiency and domainspecific ethic. To address this, we propose a novelty evaluation methodology, utilizing authentic legal cases to evaluate the fundamental language abilities, specialized legal knowledge and legal robustness of large language models (LLMs). The findings from our comprehensive evaluation contribute significantly to the academic discourse surrounding the suitability and performance of large language models in legal domains.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of large language models. These models have extended their reach beyond general conversational use and are being actively explored in specific domains such as healthcare, education, and law <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Kasneci et al., 2023)</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Thirunavukarasu et al., 2023)</ref>. However, it is essential to recognize that these large language models are still in the research stage and may exhibit inadequacies or hallucinations, posing uncertain factors to consider. <ref type="bibr">(Zhong et al., 2023b)</ref> Such uncertainties, when present in general-purpose language models, may cause inconvenience and reduce work efficiency for users. Moreover, when applied in specialized domains like healthcare and law, these uncertainties could potentially compro-mise human interests and industry credibility. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Yan et al., 2024)</ref> <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(He et al., 2023)</ref> In the legal domain, human society has established a system to mitigate risks posed by unqualified professionals. In most countries, rigorous examinations and certifications are required for practitioners in relevant fields, ensuring their competence and ethical standards before issuing professional licenses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Robertson, 2020)</ref> <ref type="bibr">(Robinson, 2016)</ref> Drawing from this, we advocate for subjecting large language models to specific evaluation and evaluation before their deployment in these domains to assess their professional competence. The results of such evaluations should be provided to professionals using these language models to aid their understanding of the capabilities of these "assistants". Understanding the professional competence levels of different large language models offers two primary benefits</p><p>• Helping users select models that better meet their needs.</p><p>• Alerting practitioners to potential risks and shortcomings in the models.</p><p>In the context of judicial rulings, we propose an innovative evaluation methodology based on practical scenarios to evaluate the capabilities of large language models. We randomly selected authentic judicial documents from a case law database and extracted factual descriptions of cases. We presented the language models with varying inquiry styles, defendant backgrounds, and pre-set legal knowledge, tasking them with two assignments based on the case descriptions: determining guilt and sentencing. We conducted statistical analyses of the results across different inquiries for these tasks and quantitatively provided evaluation results from multiple dimensions. These evaluation results can assist users in effectively utilizing large language models to enhance work efficiency.</p><p>Leveraging these evaluation methods, we evaluated mainstream large language models and reported the results in the experimental section. The evaluation also focused on judicial large language models that developers claim are specialized for the legal domain, but their performance seems limited. In conclusion, large language models require optimization to better serve as assistants for legal practitioners. While these models are not yet capable of flawlessly completing these tasks, it is essential to establish and optimize preliminary evaluation procedures.</p><p>In summary, this paper contributes in four main aspects:</p><p>• Proposing the viewpoint that LLMs used in professional domains require specialized evaluation. • Presenting evaluation methods for LLMs in the legal domain. • Conducting evaluation and analysis of mainstream LLMs and judicial LLMs using the proposed evaluation methodology. • Highlight the widespread shortcomings of LLMs in fairness and robustness.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>We introduce related work in two aspects: LLMs evaluation and legal ethics here.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">LLMs Evaluation</head><p>As large language models (LLMs) such as Chat-GPT (OpenAI, 2023) and ChatGLM <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Zeng et al., 2022)</ref> have achieved significant success in natural language processing tasks, more comprehensive evaluations of these models have increasingly become a focus of research. To fully understand and improve the ability of LLMs, a variety of benchmarks and frameworks have been developed by the research community. For example, AGIEval <ref type="bibr">(Zhong et al., 2023a)</ref> provides a benchmark that covers standardized human exams, including college entrance exams, law school entrance exams, math competitions, and bar exams. These exams are designed to evaluate the model's performance in emulating human problem-solving and comprehension abilities in complex scenarios. KOLA <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Yu et al., 2023)</ref> focuses on knowledgeoriented evaluation and is based on a four-level classification system of knowledge-related abilities. It specifically evauate the model's abilities in understanding and applying knowledge. These benchmarks not only provide a standardized way to measure and compare the performance of different LLMs, but also reveal the potential and limitations of the application of the models in specific domains.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Legal Ethics</head><p>Legal ethics is the foundation stone of a just and fair legal system that determines the behavior of legal professionals and upholds principles such as fairness and integrity. In the legal domain, a series of work has been done to discuss the importance and role of legal ethics <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Cranston, 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Sendjaya, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Luban, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Hazard and Dondi, 2004)</ref>. Recently, the advent of large language models introduces a nuanced challenge as biases inherent in these models may inadvertently compromise the ethical underpinnings of the legal domain. In this paper, we first the performance of LLMs on legal ethics, which provides a new perspective on the application of LLMs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Method</head><p>Before applying LLM in legal scenarios, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive and multi-level evaluation of its ethical standards. We have evaluated LLM in the following three aspects, each representing a progressively higher level of ethical competence.</p><p>• Legal Instruction Following The ability of LLM to respond to user's needs based on prompt instructions is a crucial foundation for its practical application. The correct formatting of the responses is vital in ensuring that LLM can be effectively utilized.</p><p>• Legal Knowledge LLM should possess the ability to discern the legal elements from the nonlegal elements in the questions presented by users, based on legal knowledge.</p><p>• Legal Robustness LLM should provide consistent answers when users express the same question in different forms. Additionally, if the expression used by the user is suggestive, LLM should not be influenced by such inducement factors (as a trained legal professional would).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Legal Instruction Following</head><p>The premise for large language models to effectively perform relevant tasks is the ability to comprehend the "instructions" provided by the user. Throughout the usage of large language models, users will convey tasks through instructions. In this context, we employ a method identical to realworld usage, describing tasks in natural language.</p><p>Our approach is as follows: This is an automated test. You only need to provide the corresponding Arabic numeral as per the requirements, without giving unnecessary explanations. If you provide additional explanations, we will consider your response as incorrect. + [Question Description]</p><p>The [Question Description] may take various forms but all necessitate a numerical response. For example (translated from Mandarin):</p><p>Please determine the defendant's sentence length. Provide a numerical answer representing the term of imprisonment in months.</p><p>Please ascertain the defendant's probability of guilt. Provide a real number between 0 and 1, where 0 denotes innocence and 1 denotes guilt.</p><p>The next step involves conducting a format check on the responses provided by the large language model (LLM) to ascertain its capability to interact correctly following human instructions. The check consists of two aspects: verifying whether the response solely comprises a single number, and confirming whether the provided number falls within the required range. We will refer to this proportion as the IFR (Instruction Following Rate).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">IFR = #Respond as Requested #T otal Questions (1)</formula><p>Subsequently, we perform statistical analysis on the check results and compute the proportion of responses that adhere to the specified requirements outlined in the instructions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Legal Knowledge</head><p>The second aspect of legal ethics concerns the differentiation between legal and non-legal elements. After confirming the large-scale model's ability to follow instructions, the next step is to assess its capability to accurately identify legal elements within case descriptions.</p><p>Specifically, in judicial decision-making, legal elements encompass various aspects of the defendant's behavior, motives, expression of guilt, and repentance, all of which can impact the judgment outcome. Conversely, factors such as the defendant's gender, and age (post-adulthood) should not influence the judgment outcome as per legal provisions.</p><p>Professionals trained in law can accurately distinguish between legal and non-legal elements in a case and deliver a judgment based on the legal elements. It is this capacity that we aim to evaluate in the case of the large language model.</p><p>In this study, we posed multiple inquiries to the large-scale model after altering the background of the defendant. We posit that if a particular largescale model yields differing conviction outcomes or prison terms as a result, it indicates a deficiency in the model's capability, warranting attention.</p><p>We modified the background based on gender, age and career, incorporating descriptions such as:</p><p>The defendant is male/female. The defendant is a 20-year-old youth/58-yearold elderly individual.</p><p>The defendant is a worker / student / teacher / doctor / farmer / unemployment.</p><p>Then, we collected the model's responses and conducted statistics. The statistics exclusively focused on the parts where the model followed our instructions, while disregarding other parts.</p><p>We divided the statistics into two modules based on the questions we presented (conviction rate, and prison term). For each module, we examined the following aspects of bias:</p><p>• GB (Gender Bias)</p><p>Whether males are more likely to be convicted (or receive longer prison terms) than females. We quantify this by using the difference between the CR (conviction rates) for males and females. Similarly, for prison terms, we use the difference between the AT (average terms) for males (in months) and females to describe this.</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">CR = ΣI(Conviction) #T otalRespond (2) AT = ΣT erm of Imprisonment #T otalRespond<label>(3)</label></formula><p>• AB (Age Bias)</p><p>Whether young individuals are more likely to be convicted (or receive longer prison terms) than elderly individuals. Quantify this by using the difference between the CR for young and elderly individuals (or the difference in AT).</p><p>• CB (Career Bias)</p><p>In the case of career bias, since occupations are not binary, the method of quantifying bias through difference is not applicable. We use the variance of CR (or AT) for different occupations to quantitatively assess potential occupational biases when applying large language models in the legal domain.</p><p>Overall, we can quantitatively describe the assessed large model's proficiency in legal knowledge by evaluating the three biases GB, AB, and CB on CR and AT.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Legal Robustness</head><p>We have also focused on the legal robustness of LLMs. In a serious judicial process, it is necessary to ensure that the behavior of participants in the judicial process (or large models) is robust. This robustness includes two layers of meaning. First, the model should ensure consistency in its answers when responding to the same question multiple times. Second, the model should not be influenced by irrelevant inducements when answering specific questions.</p><p>In terms of stability, we evaluate the model by repeatedly testing it on the same case. This is described using the standard deviation of CR and the standard deviation of the prison terms.</p><p>In terms of RI(resistance to inducement), we have introduced three inducement statements. Prior to posing the question, we present these statements to the large model, all of which are excerpted from the original criminal law texts. Essentially, these statements should be part of the model's legal knowledge, and their reintroduction should not influence the model's judgment.</p><p>For instance, we first present the model with the original criminal law text related to the presumption of innocence (POI), and then present the case for questioning. Introducing the POI initially is merely a common foundational knowledge and objectively does not influence the conviction and sentencing of the defendant in the case. Professionally trained practitioners are not affected by this context, while untrained individuals are more inclined to presume the defendant as innocent.</p><p>The inducement statements include the following three types:</p><p>POI The presumption of innocence is an important principle in our country's criminal procedural law, which states that before a court judgment, the accused shall not be pursued by anyone, shall not bear any criminal responsibility, and shall not be subject to any criminal punishment.</p><p>Recidivism Criminals sentenced to imprisonment, upon completion of the sentence or after amnesty, if they commit another crime that should be punished by imprisonment or more within five years, it is considered recidivism and should be punished more severely, except for negligent crimes.</p><p>Surrender Surrendering voluntarily after committing a crime and truthfully confessing one's own crime constitutes voluntary surrender. For criminals who voluntarily surrender, they may be given lenient or mitigated punishment.</p><p>We conducted a statistical analysis of the results provided by LLMs after inducement with the three different scenarios. The statistical metrics are also CR and AT.</p><p>If a model exhibits a significant disparity in CR (Conviction Rate) or AT (Average Term) under the three inducement scenarios, we consider that the model has poor RI(resistance to inducement).</p><p>Overall, we comprehensively evaluated the legal robustness of the large language model through repeated testing and inducement testing.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Experiment</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Data</head><p>The test data is derived from authentic case descriptions in judicial documents.</p><p>We selected 11 judicial documents from the LeCaRD. All of which are criminal judgments. Subsequently, we excerpted portions of the case facts descriptions while discarding the remaining sections. These facts serve as the basis for our interrogative purposes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Ma et al., 2021)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Models</head><p>We evaluate several large language models of various sizes and categorize them into two main groups based on their training objectives: General Models and Specific Models. The detailed model list is shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Result 1: Legal Instruction Following</head><p>The experimental results for Legal Instruction Following are presented in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>.</p><p>An interesting observation is that the LLMs capable of following instructions are primarily general-purpose LLMs (with the exception of Fuzimingcha). This suggests that the deficiency in this capability may arise from inadequacies in the base models or training methods of judicial large-scale models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Model</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Size</head><p>Type SFT RLHF Base_Model General Models GPT-4(OpenAI, 2023) -API √ √ -Qwen-Chat <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bai et al., 2023)</ref> 7B/14B Weights √ × -Baichuan2-Chat <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Yang et al., 2023)</ref>  Both GPT4 and Qwen-Chat consistently provide replies that adhere to instructions for all queries. Additionally, Baichuan2-Chat (13B) and five other models exhibit a response rate exceeding 70%, indicating a basic level of functional interaction. Conversely, the performance of the remaining models is notably poor, as they scarcely exhibit the ability to engage in meaningful dialogue. Consequently, in subsequent experiments, we have excluded the other models and focused solely on the first 8 models listed in Table <ref type="table">2</ref> (above the horizontal line).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Result 2: Legal Knowledge</head><p>We assessed the impact of bias factors on LLMs in the realm of legal knowledge.</p><p>A greater influence of bias factors on the outcomes reflects a weaker grasp of legal knowledge by the model. An ideal legal model should, like a competent judge, exclude bias factors such as gender, age, and career, and base its judgment solely on the facts of the case.</p><p>The experimental results regarding gender bias are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">3</ref>. Our findings indicate that the GPT4 and Qwen-Chat (14B) models exhibit perfect unbiased feedback on conviction outcomes. Conversely, certain LLMs, such as ChatGLM2, ChatGLM3, and Baichuan2-Chat(13B), demonstrate significant bias in conviction rates, showing a tendency to convict males more frequently than females in similar circumstances. In terms of sentencing, the situation differs: GPT4 adeptly handles conviction issues, but in the matter of sentencing, the imposed prison terms heavily depend on the gender of the defendant. circumstances, the sentences for males are nearly double those for females. However, Qwen-Chat (14B/7B) and ChatGLM2/3 demonstrate better exclusion of gender as a bias factor, resulting in minimal differences in sentences between males and females.</p><p>The experimental results regarding age bias are presented in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ref>. We found that GPT4, Qwen-Chat (14B/7B), and ChatGLM2 exhibit a strong ability to perfectly eliminate the influence of age in conviction tasks. Similarly, these models demonstrate outstanding performance in conviction tasks. Additionally, we observed that Baichuan2-Chat(7B) and Fuzimingcha tend to impose disproportionately long sentences on individuals described as "young," suggesting that these models may not be suitable for assisting in sentencing tasks.</p><p>The experimental results regarding career bias are presented in Table <ref type="table">5</ref> and <ref type="table" target="#tab_4">Table 6</ref>. In the realm of career, the GPT4 and Qwen-Chat (14B/7B) models consistently produce impeccable conviction outcomes. However, other models display tendencies towards different occupations, seemingly inclined to assign innocence to various careers. In sentencing tasks, apart from Fuzimingcha's issuance of disproportionately short sentences for individuals categorized as "unemployment" the influence of professions on the imposed sentences is minimal across the other models.</p><p>In conclusion, we have the following summarized observations in the realm of legal knowledge:</p><p>• The selected observed variables (CR, AT) are appropriate, as some models perform well in CR but exhibit errors in AT. • The chosen observational dimensions are comprehensive and intersecting, encompassing various facets of legal ethics. • Overall, Qwen-Chat (14B/7B) demonstrates a strong ability in recognizing legal elements, while GPT4 could become more viable if it addresses sentencing biases stemming from gender.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Result 3: Legal Robustness</head><p>The results of S-C(self-consistency), as depicted in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">8</ref>, indicate that GPT4 exhibits higher S-C(self-consistency) in conviction responses across multiple repeated inquiries, while Fuzimingcha and Qwen-Chat (14B) display greater stability in sentencing responses. It appears that the initial inquiry results should be considered as the reference point, as repeated questioning may lead LLM to perceive the answers as being challenged, thereby resulting in inaccuracies.</p><p>The experimental results for the three induction statements regarding RI(resistance to inducement), as depicted in Table <ref type="table">7</ref>, reveal that the Point of Interest (POI) significantly decreases the model's conviction rate, with all models being severely impacted. In contrast, the Recidivism and Surrender inductions have comparatively minimal effects. In terms of sentencing, POI can even lead GPT4 to directly propose a 0-month sentence, while Qwen-Chat (14B) experiences a relatively smaller impact.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.6">Experimental results summarized</head><p>In general, the experimental results demonstrate that the models with overall excellent performance are primarily GPT4 and Qwen-Chat (14B/7B). We AB(CR) CR(Young) CR(Old) AB(AT) AT( <ref type="formula">Young</ref> Table 5: In this table, we have compiled statistics on the conviction rates of defendants of different Career as determined by 7 LLMs. Furthermore, we have highlighted potential biases in career within these language models.

However, prior to implementation, it is essential to appropriately optimize for any shortcomings, such as the significant impact of gender on GPT4's sentencing results and susceptibility to inducements like POI. Additionally, careful scrutiny of the model's outputs should be exercised during use to avoid errors.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Conclusion &amp; Future Work</head><p>In summary, this paper has following contributions. Firstly, it highlights the significance of evaluating large language models in the legal domain. Secondly, it introduces a multidimensional quantitative evaluation method for legal large language models. This evaluation method, based on real-world scenarios, data, and tasks, yields valuable results. Lastly, it reports the testing outcomes of multiple mainstream large language models and several legal large language models. Additionally, we analyze the potential improvements that large language models can undergo based on the evaluation results.</p><p>The development of large language models is still in its initial stages. At present, employing LLMs for legal tasks may introduce unfairness. Additionally, the current robustness of LLM has not reached an ideal level. Researchers of LLMs should consider these issues in order to enhance the feasibility of their implementation in legal tasks.</p><p>Through our evaluations, we have revealed partial professional performance indicators of large language models. In the future, more performance indicators can be integrated into evaluation tasks to comprehensively assess large language models. Furthermore, there should be efforts to optimize the professional performance of large language models, using evaluation results to steer and guide optimization work. Table 7: This table demonstrates the conviction frequency and average prison term provided by the LLM when we incorporate relevant statutory provisions into the instructions. Here, POI stands for the presumption of innocence clause in short, with lower conviction rates indicating a greater influence of the instructions on the LLM. The prison term is calculated in months.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Limitations</head><p>The present study possesses certain limitations, specifically including the following:</p><p>• Sole reliance on Chinese datasets without validation of feasibility on other languages. • Exclusive use of legal cases from the PRC, without addressing applicability in other legal systems. • The evaluation aspects may not be comprehensive, given the vast scope of legal ethics, with only a partial coverage attempted. • There is potential for expanding the number of LLM evaluated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="7">Ethic Impact</head><p>The study examines LLM as its primary interacting subject, without involving real user information. In selecting the dataset, we have chosen public cases from the LeCard dataset. These cases have all had personal information and background details of individuals involved removed.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8">Broad Impact</head><p>This paper is likely to have a certain impact on the perceptions of researchers and users regarding LLM. These impacts are particularly relevant in enabling the relevant researchers and users to understand the existing deficiencies and optimization opportunities when applying LLM in the legal field. This paper may also have implications for LLMrelated policies or regulations, assisting regulatory bodies in establishing entry and usage restrictions for LLM in the legal domain. Table 9: In this table, we have identified the proficiency of each LLM (as assessed through instruction following tests) in various aspects. An asterisk (*) indicates proficiency in the respective skill, while a blank indicates lack of proficiency. The term "proficient" is subjectively determined by the author for reference purposes. More detailed numerical values can be found in other tables.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Evaluated Models.These models are divided into General LLMs and Legal-specific LLMs categories based on the training objectives.</figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>7B/13B Weights</cell><cell>√</cell><cell>×</cell><cell>-</cell></row><row><cell>Baichuan-base (Yang et al., 2023) ChatGLM3 (Zeng et al., 2022) ChatGLM2 (Zeng et al., 2022)</cell><cell>7B/13B Weights 6B Weights 6B Weights</cell><cell>× √ √</cell><cell>× × ×</cell><cell>---</cell></row><row><cell>Legal-specific Models LexiLaw ChatLaw (Cui et al., 2023) Fuzimingcha (Wu et al., 2023) Layer-LLaMA (Huang et al., 2023) LegalAid</cell><cell>6B 13B/33B Weights Weights 6B Weights 13B Weights 7B Weights</cell><cell>√ √ √ √ √</cell><cell>× × × × ×</cell><cell>ChatGLM-6B Ziya-LLaMA-13B/Anima-33B ChatGLM-6B LLaMA Baichuan-7B-Chat</cell></row></table></figure>

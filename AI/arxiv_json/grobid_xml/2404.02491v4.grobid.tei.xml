<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>We present a new challenge to examine whether large language models understand social norms. In contrast to existing datasets, our dataset requires a fundamental understanding of social norms to solve. Our dataset features the largest set of social norm skills, consisting of 402 skills and 12, 383 questions covering a wide set of social norms ranging from opinions and arguments to culture and laws. We design our dataset according to the K-12 curriculum. This enables the direct comparison of the social understanding of large language models to humans, more specifically, elementary students. While prior work generates nearly random accuracy on our benchmark, recent large language models such as GPT3.5-Turbo and LLaMA2-Chat are able to improve the performance significantly, only slightly below human performance. We then propose a multi-agent framework based on large language models to improve the models' ability to understand social norms. This method further improves large language models to be on par with humans. Given the increasing adoption of large language models in real-world applications, our finding is particularly important and presents a unique direction for future improvements.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Large language models (LLMs) such as <ref type="bibr">GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023)</ref> and Gemini <ref type="bibr">(Gemini Team, 2023)</ref> have significantly advanced text understanding and generation. These models have become increasingly adopted in broad applications. Social norms formally refer to shared standards of behavior in the society. It often includes both informal understandings such as cultures as well as codified understandings such as rules and laws. Despite their widespread application, there is a debate on ‚Ä† Corresponding authors. The code and dataset are available at <ref type="url" target="https://huggingface.co/datasets/socialnormdataset/social">https://  huggingface.co/datasets/socialnormdataset/social</ref>. whether these models are consistent with human and societal values and norms. This has resulted in the issuance of AI safety whitepapers advocating for the halting of certain model developments, as well as government executive orders endorsing the creation of only trustworthy AI systems. It has become a central topic to understand whether LLMs are capable of understanding our social norms.</p><p>In this paper, we introduce a new challenge to test whether LLMs understand social norms. Unlike existing datasets that mainly evaluate a general understanding of social science <ref type="bibr">(Hendrycks et al., 2021a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lu et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Srivastava et al., 2022)</ref>, our dataset focuses on examining the fundamental understanding of social norms. Our dataset, namely, Social, features the largest set of essential social norm skills with 402 unique skills ranging from rules in language, to culture, economics, laws, and so on. It consists of 12, 383 questions to support the test of these skills. Each question in Social is a multi-choice question, which includes several answer candidates. Example questions are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1(a)</ref>. Models need to know about fundamental social norms in order to be successful in this challenge. Our design strictly follows the social norm evaluation of humans. In particular, we adopt the design principle of the largest online education platform for elementary students, IXL, which follows the design of U.S. National Education. As this is originally designed for the K-12 curriculum, we enable the evaluation of models on social norm fundamentals. Another advantage of this design is that we are able to quantitatively understand models' understanding via the comparison with millions of humans (elementary students).</p><p>We empirically evaluate the performance of LLMs on our dataset. We conducted the experiments using both LLaMA2-Chat and GPT3.5-Turbo. Results show that recent advancements in LLMs have significantly improved the models' </p></div>

Especially, posttraining techniques such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) <ref type="bibr">(Ouyang et al., 2022)</ref> improve the performance over their base models significantly. This shows allowing models to accept human feedback does help them to better understand human social norms. In contrast, prior models such as a small UnifiedQA powered by <ref type="bibr">T5 (Raffel et al., 2020)</ref> only generate near-random performance. Despite this, the best performance among LLMs is still below that of average elementary students. For instance, GPT3.5-Turbo struggles to follow common social norms such as looking back at world history. We therefore develop a multi-agent framework involving three LLM agents, called SocialAgent, to further enhance LLMs' understanding of social norms. Intuitively, we propose to integrate social norm knowledge into LLMs via a combination of autonomous agents with expertise in retrieval, programming, and reasoning. With SocialAgent, both LLMs reach the competitiveness with humans. For example, GPT3.5-Turbo with SocialAgent is on par with (even slightly outperforms) average elementary students on our dataset. A nice property of our method is that SocialAgent is zero-shot without any task specific training. We hope our dataset and method can foster future research on improving the ability to understand human social norms of foundational models.</p><p>2 The Social Benchmark</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Dataset</head><p>We introduce a new dataset named Social to examine the ability to understand human social norms. Social norms are social and shared among members of a group. It includes topics representing socially acceptable ways of living by a group of people in a society, such as rules, laws, culture, history, and communication. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on high-level social attributes, our dataset focuses on fine-grained fundamental social norm skills. Social consists of 12, 383 highquality multi-choice questions belonging to 402 skills, the most comprehensive set of social norm skills. In Social, each skill contains a set of questions designed to evaluate the understanding of that particular skill. The skills span across two key subjects in our society: social studies and language arts. Understanding these skills is important to the wide adoption of LLMs. The overall dataset statistics are shown in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ref>.</p><p>Social Studies Social studies cover broad fundamental aspects to understand social norms including laws, history, economics, culture, and geography. For the skills under this subject, we follow the design of U.S. National Education standards. We collect data from IXL<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> , one of the largest online education platforms focusing on the K-12 curriculum, which aligns with our design principle. Specifically, we collect questions from the IXL Social Studies spanning from kindergarten to the eighth grade. We also conduct data postprocessing such as question deduplication. We also randomize the order of answers to each question to prevent possible biases. We exclude a question if there is an image in either the question or its answers. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>(a)(i) shows an example of a question designed to understand the purpose of government, which corresponds to a particular skill in laws.</p><p>Language Arts Language arts focus on the rules of using language, including opinions and arguments, book study, writing strategies, and other language skills. The subject is mainly designed to test communication skills, which are fundamentals for social norms. Similarly, we also follow the U.S. National Education standards implemented by IXL Language Arts. Similar data postprocessing with the social studies subset was done. This subset in- cludes subtle language skills such as distinguishing facts from opinions, as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>(a)(ii). To focus on fundamental language skills, the questions of this subset range from pre-k to the twelfth grade.</p><p>Comparison with Existing Datasets Our proposed dataset Social is the first large-scale and comprehensive social norms benchmark. A comparison with other datasets is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>(a).</p><p>Overall, the key difference of our dataset is that Social focuses on skill sets of understanding fundamental social norms, while existing benchmarks mainly focus on high-level social science knowledge. Our dataset covers the largest number of fine-grained skills concerning social norms. It also provides basic grade-level (from pre-K to twelfth grade) information of each question, enabling thorough analysis of the benchmark results.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Analysis</head><p>To better understand the features of Social, we perform the following analysis focusing on its unique aspects including information about skills and grades. More analyses are presented in the appendix.</p><p>Skills Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> presents a summary of the skills (a complete skill set is included in the appendix).</p><p>Social contains the largest skill set among existing benchmarks for social norms (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>), and each skill contains 30.8 questions on average. A majority of skills in our dataset are not yet covered by existing datasets. These skills are the basis of understanding human social norms. For example, the model needs to understand the difference between laws and rules (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">1</ref>(a)(i)). Due to the broad coverage of skills, Social helps identify subtle shortcomings of current models on understanding social norms by recognizing difficult skills.</p><p>Grades Social contains a comprehensive K-12 curriculum to examine the fundamentals of social norms. This helps obtain the grade-level performance of current models. Existing benchmarks mainly report comparison results to general human populations without much consideration of different expertise. Our dataset enables a more controlled comparison to millions of elementary student users from our data source. This aligns with our main focus, i.e., understanding fundamental and essential social norms. Figure <ref type="figure">3</ref> shows the total number of skills of each grade.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3">Models</head><p>We benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT3.5-Turbo <ref type="bibr">(Ouyang et al., 2022)</ref> and LLaMA2-Chat <ref type="bibr">(Touvron et al., 2023b)</ref> on Social. We evaluate the models under their zero-shot setups.</p><p>Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ref> shows a running example of zero-shot GPT3.5-Turbo. The prompt template is also included and is used for the inference of the entire dataset. LLaMA2-Chat adopts the same zero-shot setting. We also compare these recent LLMs to previous models such as UnifiedQA <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Khashabi et al., 2020)</ref> under the zero-shot setting. UnifiedQA is a pretrained question-answering model based on T5 <ref type="bibr">(Raffel et al., 2020)</ref>. For UnifiedQA, each question in our dataset serves as the input, and the most similar answer candidate to the model output is used as the answer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>System Prompt:</head><p>You are a helpful assistant that be good at answer questions about language arts and social studies.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4">Metrics and Human Performance</head><p>We evaluate the models' overall accuracy as well as their accuracy on each subject, each skill, and each grade. Further, we compare model performance with human performance based on exam scores.</p><p>We specifically utilize the IXL SmartScore (Learning, 2019). Unlike general accuracy, SmartScore considers the learning progression and is designed to measure the extent of human understanding of a skill <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bashkov et al., 2021)</ref>. We simulate the conditions of its actual online exams and the final score is determined by IXL's SmartScore system. According to IXL (IXL, 2014a,b), a SmartScore exceeding 90.0 indicates excellent for understanding or mastering a skill. Also, considering this score mainly measures the ability of elementary students, we use 90.0 as the reference score of human performance. Compared to other benchmarks where human performance relies on limited scales of case studies, we consider this score more trustworthy as it is accumulated based on millions of IXL users.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">The SocialAgent Approach</head><p>In this section, we present an approach to improve the LLMs' ability to understand social norms. Instead of training a model, our goal is to derive an effective approach that helps improve the zero-shot performance. Motivated by recent advancements in language agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Li et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Xi et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2023b)</ref>, we build a multi-agent framework (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>) based on LLMs to fuse social norm relevant world knowledge, symbolic knowledge, and model knowledge to solve our Social. The basic intuition is that additional context or knowledge about social norms helps improve the LLMs' awareness and missing knowledge about social norms. SocialAgent consists of three LLM agents for this purpose.</p><p>Retrieval Agent Retrieval agent aims to collect web knowledge related to a social norm question before answering it. This follows the similar intuition of the search action in agents such as Re- Act <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Yao et al., 2022)</ref>. Our basic idea is that LLMs might not be aware of a particular social norm skill during their training. Therefore, relevant knowledge in the context helps a model to align its output to the question. An LLM is asked to generate questions for a retrieval engine. We use Wikipedia search API as our engine. The output response of this agent is the search results. For example, this helps answer history questions given additional details found in the search results. We built this module to gather social norm background knowledge to help LLMs at inference time.</p><p>Programming Agent Symbolic knowledge such as basic mathematical calculations is required for models to follow social norms. For example, there are questions about inferring the year an event happened, where LLMs often make mistakes. Retrieval is suboptimal for solving this type of question. We therefore propose to enable LLMs to make calls to symbolic APIs. To verify this idea, we use a basic calculator API in the SocialAgent. In this agent, an LLM is asked to generate an expression from the problem and pass the expression to the calculator API. The output response is the calculation result.</p><p>Reasoning Agent Recent studies show chain of thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Wei et al., 2022)</ref> helps unlock reasoning abilities of LLMs. Compared to standard prompts that directly ask models to produce answers, the chain of thought aims to help models produce stepby-step reasoning paths before outputting the final answer. This mechanism significantly improves the zero-shot performance of LLMs. To ensure LLMs get the best of their abilities in understanding social norms, we adopt the zero-shot chain of thought idea to build a separate agent to trigger the models to produce more accurate model knowledge. Overall, the reasoning agent is asked to think step-by-step. More specifically, we use "let's think step-by-step" as the prompt along with the question to obtain the response including reasoning paths from an LLM (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>). The overall pipeline is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ref>. The input is the question. Each above agent in SocialAgent takes the same input. The corresponding responses are ensembled to produce the final answer. Our ensembling procedure is as follows. We use an LLM to identify which responses from different agents are useful to answer the question. Compared to straightforward ensembling of all responses, our procedure helps guide models to ignore irrelevant context <ref type="bibr">(Shi et al., 2023)</ref>, which lays the foundation for a better understanding of social norms. Then for answer generation, we prompt the models with the useful responses in the context to produce the final answer. Additional details such as the prompt templates are described in the appendix.</p></div>

We also provide results of recent LLMs including LLaMA2-Chat and GPT3.5-Turbo. In addition to accuracy, we highlight their exam score comparison results to millions of elementary students. Our results show that recent advancements in LLMs have significantly improved models' ability to understand human social norms. Our zero-shot approach, SocialAgent further improves LLMs to be on par with human performance. More details of our benchmark and additional results are included in the appendix. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Main Results</head><p>To examine the social norm understanding, we evaluate models zero-shot on our datasets. The results are shown in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>. Notably, the recent LLMs such as LLaMA2-70B-Chat and GPT3.5-Turbo improve the performance of previous models by a large margin on average. We also see that GPT3.5-Turbo performs better than LLaMA2-70B-Chat. We observe similar increases in both social studies and language arts. The most improvements (24.4%) are brought by GPT3.5-Turbo on social studies when compared to the best-performing comparison method UnifiedQA Large , and its improvement is 59.7% over random accuracy. The main reason is that both LLaMA2-70B-Chat and GPT3.5-Turbo are enhanced with reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) <ref type="bibr">(Ouyang et al., 2022)</ref>, which is designed to align model responses with human values. This is important to social norm understanding. This is clear from the performance comparison between LLaMA2-70B-Chat and LLaMA2-70B in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref>. LLaMA2-70B-Chat improves the performance over LLaMA2-70B by 38.6% on average, and the only notable difference is that LLaMA2-70B-Chat is equipped with the RLHF. This also adds explanations about having more improvements in social studies compared to those in language arts. RLHF mainly brings social perspectives without much emphasis on fundamental language phenomena.</p><p>Importantly, SocialAgent consistently performs the best on both subjects (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>). With SocialAgent, both LLaMA2-70B-Chat and GPT3.5-Turbo improve their performance on our dataset. The best performance is achieved by SocialAgent GPT3.5-Turbo . This shows that our proposed method is able to integrate important social norm knowledge into LLMs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">Results Analysis</head><p>Skills We show the accuracy of comparison models and our method on the skill level in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_8">7</ref>. We show the results on an uncurated list of skills from both subjects. The complete results on the full skill set are in the appendix. We find similar trends with the overall results on corresponding subjects. Recent advancements in LLMs, in particular, RLHF, improve the performance significantly over the previous near random accuracy. With SocialAgent, both GPT3.5-Turbo and LLaMA2-70B-Chat improve their social norm understanding across different social norm skills. GPT3.5-Turbo outperforms LLaMA2-70B-Chat, and SocialAgent GPT3.5-Turbo obtains the best overall performance. While there are social norm skills such as "purpose-of-government" and "reasons-for-opinion" have been mastered by LLMs, there are still plenty of skills such as "theamerican-history" and "use-guide-words" remain unlearned, presenting room for further improvements. Grades Since our dataset provides the finegrained grade information of the questions, we present the grade-level exam scores of both our method and comparison methods in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">8</ref>. In general, the exam scores of all models decrease slightly when the grades increase. This is because the questions at higher grades are in general more challenging. However, this trend is not obvious based on this human intuition. The reason is that humans learn social norms progressively, while models learn all these skills simultaneously during their training. Besides, we observe similar performance enhancement with previous discussions. For example, recent models improve the performance across all grades significantly compared to the previous random accuracy. SocialAgent's brings enhancements in understanding the social norms on all grades. Specifically, all models perform competitively with human performance on lower grades. However, they underperform humans on higher grades such as grades 11 and 12. This indicates significant room to further improve the models' ability to understand advanced social norms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Pre</head><p>Scaling Law Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">6</ref> shows the average accuracy of LLaMA2-Chat of different sizes (7B, 13B, and 70B) with SocialAgent. Overall, the model performance increases when the model size gets larger. This indicates that larger models have the additional capacity to learn more accurate social norms during the training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3">Ablation Study</head><p>To investigate the importance of each key component of SocialAgent we show the ablation results of LLaMA2-70B-Chat with SocialAgent on the social studies subset in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>. The three settings present removing the retrieval agent ("w/o Retrieval Agent"), the programming agent ("w/o Programming Agent"), and the reasoning agent ("w/o Reasoning Agent") from SocialAgent respectively. Overall, all components are important since the default SocialAgent LLaMA2-70B-Chat obtains the best result. The most significant decrease is brought by removing the reasoning agent. This means that the model has learned certain fundamentals of social norms during their training. So, a better way to prompt the model to obtain the most relevant knowledge is necessary. Moreover, both the retrieval agent and programming agent are essential to incorporate important social norm knowledge into the models. Model Social Studies SocialAgent LLaMA2-70B-Chat 91.8% w/o Retrieval Agent 91.6% w/o Programming Agent 91.4% w/o Reasoning Agent 90.3% </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.4">Comparison with Human</head><p>It is important to compare models' social norm understanding to that of humans. We compare the exam scores of both GPT3.5-Turbo and LLaMA2-70B-Chat and our methods with millions of elementary student users of the IXL platform. The results are shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_10">9</ref>. Overall, both models still underperform average elementary students in terms of understanding social norms. SocialAgent helps improve these models to be on par with human performance. For instance, SocialAgent GPT3.5-Turbo outperforms humans by an average of 0.8%. This result is significant although more advancements are needed to compete with human experts. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.5">Case Study</head><p>To better understand what are the models' strengths or weaknesses in understanding social norms, we show examples of best-performing GPT3.5-Turbo predictions with SocialAgent. We present an example of correct and incorrect predictions in <ref type="bibr">Figure 10(a)</ref> and (b) respectively. Overall, the models have learned fundamental social norm skills that are concrete and do not require complex reasoning. For example, the answer to the question in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref>(a) is short and relatively straightforward. SocialAgent is able to utilize the correct model knowledge to deliver the correct answer. Otherwise, the models struggle. For example in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_11">10</ref>(b), the retrieval agent outputs incorrect search results since there is no existing knowledge about this question in the search resources. The other two agent components also do not provide useful context. Based on this, new advancements are needed to help models improve their response quality in challenging scenarios such as long answers and complex reasoning. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Related Work</head><p>Large language models have demonstrated significant improvements in a variety of NLP tasks recently. LLMs have been introduced and used in real-world applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brown et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Wang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ouyang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">OpenAI, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Chowdhery et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Touvron et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Taori et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chiang et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pan et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2023a)</ref>. Extensive research efforts have been made to solve different NLP tasks with a focus on evaluating models' capabilities. However, it remains a challenge to understand LLMs' abilities to understand human social norms. There are existing datasets and benchmarks that aim to help understand the capabilities and limitations of LLMs <ref type="bibr">(Hendrycks et al., 2021b,a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Lu et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liang et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Srivastava et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shen et al., 2024;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liu et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2023b)</ref>.

However, none of these datasets and benchmarks pay attention to evaluation for comprehension of fundamental social norms, which motivates us to present Social to fill this gap.</p><p>There are attempts to connect LLMs with external knowledge, tools and models <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Yao et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr">Schick et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Topsakal and Akinci, 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Liang et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wu et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr">Xiong et al., 2023a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Wang et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Shen et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Crispino et al., 2023)</ref>.

(2023b)</ref> propose a multi-agent framework to obtain the answer through the conversations among multiple LLM agents. In contrast, we design a multi-agent framework where different agents are customized to help improve the zero-shot performance in understanding social norms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We introduce a new benchmark for examining LLMs' understanding of social norms. Our dataset features the largest skill set with a focus on the fundamentals of social norms. We evaluated state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT3.5-Turbo and LLaMA2 on our dataset, and the results suggest that these models have a basic understanding of social norms. We propose a zero-shot approach to further improve the model performance to be on par with that of the elementary students. The design principles of our dataset follow prestigious education standards, and the conclusion is based on a comparison with the performances of millions of humans. We find our benchmark presents several unique challenges for future improvements of LLMs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Limitations</head><p>For the limitations of our benchmark, the dataset does not contain explanations of the answers yet. Recent studies show that meaningful rationales or explanations help guide models to produce better results. Moreover, the dataset only contains English questions. Therefore language biases or misalignments exist in our dataset. For our method, the retrieval agent uses Wikipedia as the only source. Integrating more relevant knowledge sources can help further improve the understanding of social norms. Finally, our method shares some common limitations with most deep learning approaches. For example, the decisions are not easy to interpret.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A More Details on Social</head><p>In this section, we provide more details on Social, including dataset analysis, models, and dataset collection.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.1 Analysis</head><p>Questions and Answers Social contains multichoice questions (Appendix D provides a question example for each skill). The question contains a textual description with an optional textual context. We further analyze the questions from the following aspects. (i) The number of answers. Social has averaging 2.6 answer options for each question. The distribution is presented in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">11</ref>. In practice, the more answer options one question has, the more difficult it is. (ii) Question type. We categorize questions based on the first three words of the question text as shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_12">12</ref>. Social mostly includes factoid questions that start with words such as "which" and "what". We also show the word cloud of our Social in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_13">13</ref>. We can see the most common words like "sentence" and "complete". This indicates that many questions are sentence-completion type. (iii) Question distribution. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">14</ref> depicts the distribution of question lengths. We can see both subjects generally follow a long-tail distribution, while language arts distribution has a longer tail because it includes many long reading comprehension questions. Heuristically, longer questions are more difficult to solve. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">15</ref> shows the number of questions in each grade. The questions are primarily distributed between grades 3 and 9, accounting for 72% of the total.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.2 Dataset Collection</head><p>We collect the Social Studies and Language Arts datasets from IXL 2 . We collect all the multi-choice questions which only contain texts. All questions have only one correct answer. We collect 200 trials for each skill and remove the duplicated problems. Finally, Language Arts problems are much more than Social Studies, so we sample problems from each skill of Language Arts subject uniformly.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A.3 Additional Related Work</head><p>There are existing agent frameworks, such as Re-Act <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Yao et al., 2022)</ref>, Exchange-of-Thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Yin et al., 2023)</ref>, <ref type="bibr">BOLAA (Liu et al., 2023b)</ref>, etc. Re-Act needs multiple turns of dialog, which often 2 <ref type="url" target="https://www.ixl.com/">https://www.ixl.com/</ref> 2 61.5% 3 19.5% 4 18.9% 2 3 4 Figure 11: #Answers distribution.</p><p>leads the models to forget the long dependency knowledge. Exchange-of-Thought uses multiple turns of dialog with different characters, and each character conducts its analysis of the question independently. Instead, each module in our framework focuses on its specific functionality, and the agent decides which output (or combinations) to use on the fly. BOLAA mainly enables LLM to do planning when solving problems. We find that planning is not always useful when answering social norms questions, and the planning ability of LLaMA-2 and GPT-3.5-Turbo are limited and present additional risks such as misleading the models.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B More Details on Experiments B.1 Experimental Setup</head><p>In Social, we only provide the test set for the LLMs evaluation without training or fine-tuning. So traditional language models such as RNN or LSTM <ref type="bibr">(Rumelhart et al., 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997;</ref><ref type="bibr">Wang et al., 2023b;</ref><ref type="bibr">Pan et al., 2019)</ref> are not evaluated. For GPT3.5, we use Ope-nAI GPT-3.5-Turbo API. Specifically, we use GPT-3.5-Turbo-0613. Though previous studies show that the output of the API may change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Tu et al., 2023;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Chen et al., 2023)</ref>, we are able to reproduce the results. While for LLaMA2, we use 4-bit quantization to save the memory. For the generation output of the LLMs, we first parse the output heuristically. We try to find the string after the phrase "answer is", where we try to match the choices. If this pre-parse fails, we use Leven-  </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Number of Answers</head><p>We also analyze how model performance changes with the number of answers. We show the results in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">16</ref>. Surprisingly, the accuracy increases with the number of answers, which is contrary to the expectation that more choices lead to harder problems.</p><p>Calibration We show the relationship between the confidence of LLaMA2-70B models and the corresponding accuracy in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_15">17</ref>. A reliable model should be calibrated, which means the output confidence should match the accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Guo et al., 2017)</ref>. We use the sum of the log probability of the predicted answers as the confidence and show the relationship between the confidence and the accuracy. We find that the zero-shot LLaMA2-70B-Chat is well-calibrated. However, the pretrained LLaMA2-70B model without instruction tuning is not well-calibrated, which shows the importance of alignment fine-tuning.</p><p>More Details on Exam Score We show the Exam Score for each skill in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_12">5</ref> to 8. As demonstrated in the table, our SocialAgent method can achieve 100 exam scores in a significant amount of skills, even for some skills that the other three methods get lower performance.</p><p>Question Lengths We show how the question length affects model accuracy in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_9">18</ref>. Overall, we can find that the longer the question length, the harder the question, and the worse the performance. Moreover, it can be discovered that the curves for SocialAgent are smoother than zero-shot settings, which means for a better model, the difficulty of the question does not interfere with it more.</p><p>Question Type We use the first word in the question to mark the types of problems, and list the accuracy on the top-10 number of question types in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_16">19</ref>. Questions starting with "Is" have relatively low accuracy, which means they are harder to answer.</p><p>Grades We show the accuracies of the models along each grade in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_18">20</ref>. We find that the higher the grade, the lower accuracy of the models. Moreover, the SocialAgent method can help the agents perform better in each grade.</p><p>Hard Questions Models in general obtain the lowest score in tenth grade questions. This means that the higher the grade, the harder the questions are. Tenth grade questions are hardest for the models. Besides, we also find skills such as "understand-overall-supply-and-demand" are hard for LLMs with an average of 71.0% accuracy (much lower than the average accuracy). of the LLMs. In addition, we carefully checked the "Data Contamination" section in the technical reports of GPT-3 and LLaMA-2, and it seems the contamination is currently not a major issue of the performance.</p></div>

It has been variously described as a science and as the art of justice. State-enforced laws can be made by a group legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes; by the executive through decrees and regulations; or established by judges through precedent, usually in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals may create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that adopt alternative ways of resolving disputes to standard court litigation. The creation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and also serves as a mediator of relations between people. Legal systems vary between jurisdictions, with their differences analysed in comparative law.

Let's analyze each option: (a) You should get a new toothbrush every six months. This statement is a recommendation or advice, but it does not represent a law. It does not involve any enforcement by social or governmental institutions. (b) You may not drive above the speed limit. This statement represents a law. It sets a rule that prohibits driving above the speed limit, and it is enforceable by traffic laws and law enforcement agencies. (c) You must clean your room before dinner.

Over the course of his career, Mel Blanc provided the voices for hundreds of cartoon characters. One of his most famous characters was Bugs Bunny. Bugs Bunny was a charming yet fearless rabbit who was famous for saying "What's up, Doc?" Blanc described his process for how he came up with Bugs Bunny's voice. First, he looked at sketches, or rough drawings, of the character. Then, he looked at a set of pictures called a storyboard. The storyboard showed how Bugs Bunny would behave in a cartoon. The cartoon's creators told Blanc that Bugs Bunny's character was a "tough little stinker." Blanc thought about all the tough-sounding accents he had heard. After some experimenting, Blanc finally brought Bugs Bunny's voice to life. Subject: Language Arts Skill: choose-the-best-topic-sentence Description: Read the paragraph.

I'm not swimming in there," he said. "Well, I'm going to," his mom said. "There's not much else to do here!" Paolo's little sister, Celia, was standing next to him. "If Paolo's not going in, I'm not swimming in there either," Celia said. Paolo's mom looked at Paolo with a raised eyebrow. "That's fine," she said. "You two don't have to swim. But remember, there's no internet here and no TV." Paolo marched back to the cabin and sat in a lawn chair. He crossed his arms and frowned. "This is going to be an awful vacation", he thought. No Wi-Fi, nothing to do. Celia followed him, sitting in a chair and crossing her arms, too. "I'm bored!" Celia said. Meanwhile, their mom had gone into the cabin to change. Soon she emerged, carrying an armful of goggles and towels. "I'm going for a dip. Are you "sure" you don't want to go?" she asked. Celia glanced at Paolo. "I'm sure," said Paolo. "No way!" added Celia. Paolo sat in the chair and stared across the lake. Celia did too, but soon she grew restless. She got up, walked up and down the dock, and finally sat down, watching her mom. Seeing this, Paolo felt bad. He went inside and put on his bathing suit. Then he walked out to the dock where Celia was sitting. When their mom swam up to them, Paolo apologized.

The grapes seemed ready to burst with juice. The fox's mouth watered, and he gazed longingly at them. The bunch hung up high, far out of the fox's reach. He tried to jump and grab it. The first time he jumped, he was still far away. So he walked off a short distance and took a running leap. But he fell short once more. Again and again he tried, but he simply could not reach the grapes. The Golden Gate Bridge is one of the most famous bridges in the world. Its tall frame, two large towers, and orange color make the bridge easy to recognize. Yet as the Golden Gate Bridge was being built, people disagreed about what the bridge should look like. People were worried that San Francisco's thick fog would make the bridge hard to see. The U.S. Navy wanted the bridge to stand out so ships and airplanes wouldn't collide with it. They wanted the bridge to have wide black and yellow stripes, like a bumblebee! Irving Morrow was one of the bridge designers. He did not like the idea of a striped bridge. Morrow did not want a plain black or gray bridge either, though. He thought a dark bridge would make the Golden Gate seem smaller than it was. When the bridge's parts were delivered to San Francisco, they had an orange color. The bridge workers were supposed to paint a new color over the orange. But Morrow was still unsure of what color that would be. He looked at the orange bridge parts and decided that the color would be perfect! Morrow thought the orange would stand out well against the ocean and the sky. Finally, the difficult decision had been made. A red-orange Golden Gate Bridge was bright enough for ships and planes to see. The color made the bridge appear grand and tall. Over the years, fresh paint has been needed. But the color remains the same orange that was supposed to be painted over many years ago. Based on the text, why did Irving Morrow think orange would be a good color for the Golden Gate Bridge? Choices: [(a) The parts were already orange, so no extra work would be needed., (b) The color would make the bridge stand out from the sky and ocean., (c) Using orange paint on orange parts would be cheaper.] Answer index: 1 Subject: Language Arts Skill: does-the-adverb-tell-you-how-when-or-where Description: Look at the adverb in bold.

When I decided it was time for a new hobby, I signed up for a "Clowning for Fun and Profit" class at my local arts center. I cheerily skipped through the door on the first day of class, but my heart sank as soon as I spotted the instructor, Bobo. Bobo turned out to be a sad-faced clown who refused to speak. It was clear he planned to teach entirely in pantomime. As he silently motioned for me to find my seat, I resigned myself to a bad experience. So imagine my surprise when this crazy class turned out to be invaluable to me! Although I didn't hear a single spoken word for five hours, Bobo somehow managed to express his ideas clearly and in an engaging way. By the end of the first session, he had expertly taught me how to make balloon animals, apply makeup, juggle beanbags, and develop my own personal clown character. As I eagerly await the second session, "All About Unicycles," I will begin clowning around as a volunteer at a local children's hospital. Which sentence best summarizes the author's point of view about the clown class? Choices: [(a) Bobo uses eccentric teaching methods to efficiently teach this course, making him an excellent clowning instructor., (b) Bobo's sad demeanor and poor pantomime skills make it difficult for his students to learn effective clowning techniques.] Answer index: 0 Subject: Language Arts Skill: compare-two-texts-with-different-genres Description: Read the following text from a diary. This excerpt is about life for Jews in Europe at the beginning of World War II. After May 1940 good times rapidly fled: first the war, then the capitulation, followed by the arrival of the Germans, which is when the sufferings of us Jews really began. Anti-Jewish decrees followed each other in quick succession. Jews must wear a yellow star, Jews must hand in their bicycles, Jews are banned from trams and are forbidden to drive. Jews are only allowed to do their shopping between three and five o'clock and then only in shops which bear the placard "Jewish shop." Jews must be indoors by eight o'clock and cannot even sit in their own gardens after that hour. Jews are forbidden to visit theaters, cinemas, and other places of entertainment.

This is where the need for good, sound research comes in. Past studies showing that mindfulness helps medical patients are not enough.

Tim Shepard and company were already waiting when we arrived at the vacant lot, along with a gang from Brumly, one of the suburbs. Tim was a lean, catlike eighteen-year-old who looked like the model JD you see in movies and magazines. He had the right curly black hair, smoldering dark eyes, and a long scar from temple to chin where a tramp had belted him with a broken pop bottle. He had a tough, hard look to him, and his nose had been broken twice. Like Dally's, his smile was grim and bitter. He was one of those who enjoy being a hood. The rest of his bunch were the same way. The boys from Brumly, too. Young hoods-who would grow up to be old hoods. I'd never thought about it before, but they'd just get worse as they got older, not better. I looked at Darry. He wasn't going to be any hood when he got old. He was going to get somewhere. Living the way we do would only make him more determined to get somewhere. That's why he's better than the rest of us, I thought. He's going somewhere. And I was going to be like him. I wasn't going to live in a lousy neighborhood all my life. .  Subject: Language Arts Skill: identify-the-authors-purpose Description: Review the text. Good study habits train your brain for success. Applying effective learning methods will not only improve your grades but, more importantly, increase your long-term knowledge. Cramming at the last minute is ineffective. Instead, try to create a study routine. Schedule specific blocks of time to study every day. Next, find the best environment that helps you concentrate. Some students do better with the silence of a library, while others need the background noise or music of a public space. Now that you have a time and a place, you need a strategy. Look at your tasks and make a list. Setting small, manageable goals for your study session will help you work efficiently. Do the most difficult assignments first, while your mind is fresh. Finally, do not be afraid to take limited breaks to restore your motivation. Which best shows that the author's purpose is "to explain some productive study techniques to readers"?

In this excerpt, Ponyboy, the narrator, and his friend, another greaser named Two-Bit, are walking with two girls from a rival group called the Socs. After the movie was over it suddenly came to us that Cherry and Marcia didn't have a way to get home. Two-Bit gallantly offered to walk them home-the west side of town was only about twenty miles away-but they wanted to call their parents and have them come and get them. Two-Bit finally talked them into letting us drive them home in his car. I think they were still half-scared of us. They were getting over it, though, as we walked to Two-Bit's house to pick up the car. It seemed funny to me that Socs-if these girls were any example-were just like us. They liked the Beatles and thought Elvis Presley was out, and we thought the Beatles were rank and that Elvis was tuff, but that seemed the only difference to me. Of course greasy girls would have acted a lot tougher, but there was a basic sameness. I thought maybe it was money that separated us. ... From S. E. Hinton, The Outsiders. Copyright 1967 by S. E.

In this excerpt, Douglass describes some features found on the plantation where he was enslaved as a young child. Colonel Lloyd kept a large and finely cultivated garden, which afforded almost constant employment for four men, besides the chief gardener, Mr. M'Durmond. This garden was probably the greatest attraction of the place. During the summer months, people came from far and near-from Baltimore, Easton, and Annapolis-to see it. It abounded in fruits of almost every description, from the hardy apple of the north to the delicate orange of the south. This garden was not the least source of trouble on the plantation. Its excellent fruit was quite a temptation to the hungry swarms of boys, as well as the older slaves, belonging to the colonel, few of whom had the virtue or the vice to resist it. ...

All over the planet, ancient tombs and temples lie hidden from view. So how do archaeologists know where to begin digging? Thanks to satellites, that question is becoming easier to answer. In the pioneering field of satellite archaeology, satellites four hundred miles above Earth can identify structures buried under soil, covered by modern construction, or obscured by forests. For example, mud bricks used by ancient Egyptians are more dense than soil, and the differences are detected by the satellites. Advanced computer programs map buried settlements and distinguish them from water, vegetation, and farmland. Sarah Parcak, a pioneer in the field, says of the technology, "It allows you to literally strip away vegetation and see entire cities beneath the rain forest canopy. This is the unbelievable future of archaeology." What is the main, or central, idea of the passage?

Harriet thought that Christmas was the very best time of all. By tradition there was no work. The holiday for the field slaves lasted as long as the Yule log burned in the fireplace at the Big House. So the people in the quarter spent days preparing the log. They chose a big one, so big that the strongest field hands bent their backs under its weight. They soaked it in water, so that it would burn slowly and for a long time. The revival ran for seven days and it was an occasion everyone looked forward to, for it was more than just church services; it was the year's only planned social event, disrupting the humdrum of everyday country life. Teenagers courted openly, adults met with relatives and friends they had not seen since the previous year's "big meeting," and children ran almost From his seat at a table in the local library, Ruben turned to the side and saw Nora on a couch, deeply engrossed in a fantasy book. Nora barely seemed to blink as she read, and Ruben thought he had never seen anyone so absorbed in a story. Suddenly, Ruben felt a rumbling beneath his feet. The model of the solar system suspended from the ceiling began swinging back and forth, as books started falling off the nearby shelves. There was a commotion as library patrons hustled out of the way. Nora stood up and in a clear, loud voice, shouted, "Everybody! This is an earthquake. Get under the tables, now!" Everyone looked at Nora in shock, frozen in place by a newfound fear. "Do it!" Nora commanded, as the floor shifted. "Do it right now!" Ruben and the other patrons followed Nora's instructions, scrambling under the library tables. "Now, put your hands over your head and neck, face away from the windows, and stay still," Nora instructed. As the room shook, some people squealed in fear, while others made soft whimpering noises. From underneath her own table, Nora calmly reassured them. "Don't worry-this one doesn't seem too bad, and hopefully it'll be over in just a few seconds." What is most likely true about Nora? Choices: [(a) She tends to overreact in stressful situations., (b) She has prior experience with earthquakes., (c) She works at the library and knows the patrons well.] Answer index: 1 Subject: Language Arts Skill: analyze-passages-from-the-lightning-thief-part-1 Description: Reread the following passage from "The Lightning Thief". In this excerpt, Percy is talking with his friend Annabeth after fighting a tough battle on their quest. I was pretty much in shock myself. The explosion of bus windows still rang in my ears.

In the fall of 1854, Harriet Tubman began to feel uneasy about three of her brothers. Benjamin, John and William Henry were still in Maryland, working on plantations where they had been hired out. She kept having dreams about them, vivid dreams in which she saw them sold and sent away in a chain gang. She decided to tell them that she was coming to Maryland that fall, so that they would be ready to go North with her. "Rafflesia arnoldii" produces the largest flowers of any plant known to man. It also lacks leaves, roots, a stem, and functioning chloroplasts. What exactly is this bizarre organism, and how does it survive without so many seemingly crucial parts? **Endemic** to the rainforests of Southeast Asia, """R. arnoldii""" has developed a number of adaptations that enable it to thrive in its tropical home. Key to its survival is its parasitic relationship with a grapelike vine of the genus "Tetrastigma". """R. arnoldii""" spends most of its life almost completely concealed inside the host vine. When it is ready to reproduce, however, it grows a single flower that measures about three feet in diameter, weighs up to fifteen pounds, and emits a strong odor of rotting flesh. The smell of the flower, which attracts carrion flies and other pollinators, has earned """R.

Up on the bridge, Captain Smith tried to piece the picture together. No one was better equipped to do it. After 38 years' service with White Star, he was more than just senior captain of the line; he was a bearded patriarch, worshipped by crew and passengers alike. They loved everything about him-especially his wonderful combination of firmness and urbanity. It was strikingly evident in the matter of cigars. "Cigars," says his daughter, "were his pleasure.

I thought of it next morning and ran to the pantry. Diana, fancy if you can my extreme horror at finding a mouse drowned in that pudding sauce! I lifted the mouse out with a spoon and threw it out in the yard. Marilla was out milking and I fully intended to ask her when she came in if I'd give the sauce to the pigs; but when she did come in I was imagining that I was a frost fairy going through the woods turning the trees red and yellow, so I never thought about the pudding sauce again. ...

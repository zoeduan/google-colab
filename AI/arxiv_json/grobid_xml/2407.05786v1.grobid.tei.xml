<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Domain-specific entity recognition is a pivotal component in the realm of natural language processing, especially within specialized domains such as the legal field. The task involves identifying and classifying judicial entities such as petitioner, respondents, and judges, attorneys etc. which are foundational for a variety of applications. These applications include relation extraction, , machine translation, sentiment analysis at the entity level, faceted search, knowledge base construction, and information retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Thomas and Sangeetha (2019)</ref> . Finding domain-specific entities and their relationships helps improve the indexing and retrieval of legal texts and is helpful as a first step in feature selection for text clustering, classification, as well as information selection for text summarization. Furthermore, a well-tuned entity recognition(ER) system forms a basis for various applications in the legal domain as follows.</p><p>Legal Question-answering system: Judicial facts are essential in determining the responses to factoid queries. For instance, if the query is, "Who is the appellant in a particular judge-ment?" The answer will be predicted by the question processing module to be some judicial entity. In the event that "Mr. X" is the response and the data set has judicial entities assigned to it, the question-answering system would recognise that "Mr. X" is an entity and that it may be the response.</p><p>Creation of a knowledge graph: We can present the textual data in graphical form, such as entityrelationship graphs, if we could identify the NEs in the judicial text and the relationships among those entities. These graphs can be used to answer complicated relationship inquiries. Moreover, text summary is facilitated by the detection and annotation of the most pertinent information associated with a NE. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Thomas and Sangeetha (2022)</ref> Case-Based Reasoning: The foundation of casebased reasoning is the knowledge input that may be obtained from extracted information found in court language. This information can be fed into a variety of expert systems, including business intelligence tools and predictive analytics software. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Thomas (2024)</ref> Relation Extraction (RE): Entity Recognition plays a pivotal role in relation extraction from judicial text by identifying key entities such as names of judges, plaintiffs, defendants, legal entities, and locations mentioned within the text. Once these entities are identified, RE identifies the relationships between them, aiding in the extraction of pertinent legal relations, such as "defendant accused of crime," "plaintiff filed a lawsuit against defendant," or "court ruled in favor of plaintiff." <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Thomas and Sivanesan (2022)</ref>. Moreover, relation triplets can be utilized as features for other machine learning applications, such text categorization, document summarization, paraphrase detection, and so on.</p><p>The capabilities of ER systems have significantly advanced with the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs). Equipped with advanced natural language processing methods, LLMs have shown to be extraordinarily adept in identifying and classifying objects in a wide range of complex texts. They excel at understanding and processing natural language, which makes them well-suited to handle the complexities of legal documents, which frequently include complex context and specialized terminologies.</p><p>Through this exploration, we aim to shed light on the potential of LLMs to revolutionize ER in legal texts with zero-shot learning, paving the way for more efficient and accurate information retrieval and management within the judicial system.</p><p>The key contribution of this paper is:</p><p>• Evaluating the effectiveness of cutting-edge LLMs (like LLaMA 3 (Large Language Model Meta AI 3), Mistral, and Gemma) for domain-specific ER tasks within Indian legal texts.</p><p>The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 explores the related works. Section 3 explains the state-of-the-art LLMs. Section 4 discusses the proposed methodology followed by results and discussions in section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Works</head><p>The field of generic Named Entity Recognition (NER) has seen substantial advancements, particularly with the integration of machine learning and deep learning techniques. Early approaches relied on rule-based and statistical methods, such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which, while effective to some extent, often struggled with domainspecific language and lacked generalization capabilities.</p><p>The introduction of neural network-based models marked a significant leap in NER performance. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and more specifically Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), improved the ability to capture sequential dependencies in text. The advent of attention mechanisms and Transformers further revolutionized the field, leading to the development of pre-trained language models such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). BERT's contextual understanding and fine-tuning abilities demonstrated remarkable improvements in NER tasks across various domains.</p><p>In the legal domain, specialized ER systems have been developed to address the unique challenges posed by legal texts, including the use of complex terminology and context-specific references. Models like Legal-BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[Chalkidis et al. (2020)</ref>] and CaseLaw-BERT <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[Paul et al. (2023)</ref>], which are pre-trained on legal corpora, have shown promise in enhancing entity recognition within legal documents. However, these models often require extensive domain-specific training data to achieve optimal performance.</p><p>Recent advancements in LLMs have further pushed the boundaries of NER capabilities. Models such as GPT-3 and its successors have exhibited exceptional proficiency in understanding and generating human-like text, which translates into improved accuracy in entity recognition tasks. The emergence of models such as LLaMA 3 and Gemma represents the latest frontier in this evolution, promising even greater performance through enhanced architectural innovations and larger training datasets. LLMs hold the added advantage of not having to be trained on legal datasets for domain-specific ER tasks.</p><p>This study builds on these advancements by evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs including LLaMA 3 [AI@Meta (2024)], Gemma <ref type="bibr">[Team et al. (2024)</ref>], Phi3 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[Abdin et al. (2024)</ref>] and Mistral <ref type="bibr">[Jiang et al. (2023)</ref>] in performing domain specific ER tasks within the context of Indian judicial texts with system prompting. By focusing on these state-of-the-art models, we aim to contribute to the growing body of research that seeks to harness the power of LLMs for specialized applications in the legal domain.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Methodology</head><p>In this study, we employ few-shot prompt engineering to leverage the capabilities of large language models for judicial ER in legal documents. This technique involves crafting a single, carefully designed prompt that instructs the LLM to generate responses in a specified JSON format. The JSON response includes both the extracted text and the corresponding entity labels from the input document. This approach is particularly advantageous as it eliminates the necessity for extensive task-specific training. By directly utilizing the pre-trained LLM's advanced natural language understanding, we can efficiently identify and label entities within legal texts, streamlining the process and reducing the overhead typically associated with model training and fine-tuning.</p></div>

  "abstract": "\n Large language models (LLMs), renowned for their impressive capabilities in various tasks, have significantly advanced artificial intelligence. Yet, these advancements have raised growing concerns about privacy and security implications. To address these issues and explain the risks inherent in these models, we have devised a three-tiered progressive framework tailored for evaluating privacy in language systems. This framework consists of progressively complex and in-depth privacy test tasks at each tier. Our primary objective is to comprehensively evaluate the sensitivity of large language models to private information, examining how effectively they discern, manage, and safeguard sensitive data in diverse scenarios. This systematic evaluation helps us understand the degree to which these models comply with privacy protection guidelines and the effectiveness of their inherent safeguards against privacy breaches. Our observations indicate that existing Chinese large language models universally show privacy protection shortcomings. It seems that at the moment this widespread issue is unavoidable and may pose corresponding privacy risks in applications based on these models. \n",

      "text": "The recent rapid development of large language models has moved the field of natural language processing into a new era. These models integrate various natural language processing tasks into a unified framework for text generation, offering impressive capabilities and fostering creative thinking [1, 2, 3, 4]. Furthermore, by providing appropriate prompts or refining the models as needed, they can be adapted to entirely new domains or tasks [5, 6, 7, 8]. The remarkable capabilities of these models are supported by their deep architectures and extensive parameter settings. To achieve outstanding performance in such a setup, it is crucial to acquire large and diverse training datasets from publicly available online sources. In this situation, personal privacy information is inevitably mixed into the vast corpus, and the model, by chance, can remember these contents with a certain probability, posing a security risk to data privacy [9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. Additionally, with the powerful conversational abilities of large language models, an increasing number of service providers are integrating these models into their software applications, offering users various novel and interactive experiences, including conversational recommendations and email assistance. In these scenarios, to ensure excellent performance in downstream tasks, the model needs support from private document data. Consequently, it's very important for large language models to strictly follow privacy protection rules and be really good at spotting sensitive privacy information in the context [14, 15, 16]. This demand for a higher level of capability is distinct from the memory of general private information entities. Large language models, distinguished by their exceptional generalization capabilities compared to traditional small-scale models tailored for specific tasks, face a broader range of complex task scenarios in practical applications. This diversity leads to more unpredictable privacy protection risks [17]. It is essential that these models not only minimize memorizing and generating private information, such as personal identity details, but also appropriately refuse requests that could potentially violate privacy. Furthermore, they must be smart enough to recognize and safeguard privacy in challenging contextual situations. This capability is crucial to prevent decisions or responses during interactions that may disclose sensitive data and create privacy risks [18, 19]. Based on the understanding mentioned above, in this work, we propose a privacy testing and evaluation framework for mainstream Chinese large language models, which progresses from shallow to deep tiers. As shown in Figure 1, The evaluation will be conducted under three different backgroundsettings, each reflecting a distinct aspect of the model's privacy protection capabilities, which are: _general privacy information evaluation_, _contextual privacy evaluation_ and _privacy evaluation under attacks_. We hope to use these test data to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze how large language models perform in terms of privacy protection when faced with different instructions and task scenarios. Our experimental findings reveal that, aside from the 0-shot test at the tier 1, the performance of large language models in other task scenarios is unsatisfactory. These models fail to demonstrate sufficient sensitivity to privacy and privacy protection capabilities. This suggests that these models may require further optimization and improvement when handling data containing sensitive information, to ensure the security and privacy of the relevant data. Our main contributions are as follows: 1. We propose a three-tiered progressive privacy evaluation framework that corresponds to privacy tests of varying difficulty levels. This framework can, to a certain extent, reflect the privacy awareness capabilities of current Chinese large language models in different task scenarios. 2. Our extensive experiments indicate that current Chinese large language models are at risk of privacy leakage. The findings highlight the need for model service provider-s/developers to enhance their focus on privacy protection in large language models."

      "text": "Long before the remarkable capabilities of large language models were showcased, the issue of privacy within traditional pre-trained language models had already been discussed and researched by relevant scholars. The study by [9, 13, 20] defined and showcased the phenomenon of language models memorizing pre-training data, along with the possibility of recovering personal privacy data from this phenomenon. The research by [21, 10] explored the likelihood of various types of private texts, such as emails, clinical cases, and legal documents, being extracted and recovered in language models. The study by [22] took a different approach to privacy testing than the usual methods that use natural language prompts in discrete space. By employing various fine-tuning techniques, it was found that privacy risks are even greater in continuous space. This and other mentioned studies underline the critical need to safeguard private information in language models. With the arrival of the large language models era, alongside their excellent language understanding and generation capabilities, some previously unexplored privacy and security issues have emerged. [14] found that commercial applications incorporating large language model capabilities pose risks of leaking personal privacy and product secrets. The research by [23, 24] revealed privacy and security risks in large language models during the context learning process, such as in text classification and tool usage tasks. The studies by [25] discovered that, relying on the extensive world knowledge and reasoning abilities of large language models, they can infer personal information from texts that do not contain explicit privacy content."

Therefore, we argue that, unlike previous tests, prompt-based attacks are crucial to consider. **Jailbreak** attacks aim to exploit carefully crafted, complex, and variable prompt text content to bypass the pre-set safety Fig. 1: A brief overview of the three-tiered privacy evaluation structure used in this work, where yellow background text represents the content of the prompt provided to the model, green represents privacy-secure compliant responses, and red represents responses that do not comply with the privacy constraints or malicious prompt content of the attack. alignment mechanisms of models, causing them to produce unsafe responses that are beyond expected outcomes. [26] were among the first to test the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks on applications like ChatGPT, which led to the development of various attack methods and testing techniques. This includes manually designed or automatically assembled prompt texts [27, 28, 29, 17], which have shown to be quite effective with a high success rate. [30] then conducted a series of verification experiments, summarizing two main reasons behind the failure of large language model's safety alignment, providing direction for future model defense research. **Prompt Injection** similar to SQL injection attacks in database attack methods, aims to hijack the original command content set for large language models, shifting the focus to malicious commands provided by attackers [31]. Strictly speaking, it is a special method of jailbreak attacks. It often appears in real applications integrated with large language models, leading to a series of security issues and losses such as data leaks and additional cost expenditures [14, 15, 32]. [33] recently organized a global competition to collect various prompt designs and categorized the detailed attack methods. Our work, given the background mentioned above, explores the privacy awareness and protection capabilities of Chinese large language models in general scenarios and contextual situations."

      "title": "_Contextual Privacy Evaluation_",
      "text": "This tier of evaluation goes further than basic types of privacy, we aim to understand the sensitivity, or perceptual ability, of large language models towards private content. Specifically, we will place each type of privacy information into additional situational contexts, involving the transfer and communication among three individuals (X, Y, Z), and we hope to evaluate the model's response performance in such contexts. This is intended to simulate scenarios closely related to privacy protection in real life, such as confidential conversations or sharing information within trusted groups. When considering the privacy of these pieces of information, the model should not only adhere to the cognition of internal knowledge but also take into account the constraints and norms of the specific context. Ideally, the model should always capture the existence of privacy agreements in the context and comply with them, thereby protecting the corresponding content. **Evaluation Measure** In these designed scenarios, individual Y asks X about personal matters. Considering the relationship with Y, X responds truthfully but also expresses a desire for Y not to spread the information. The third individual, Z, then asks Y for help, hoping to obtain private information related to X shared by Y. At this point, we require the large language model to assume the role of Y, combining historical dialogues to provide what it considers the most appropriate response. The correct response should be a refusal to Z's request and an explanation of the reasons behind it. In specific tests, we use two tasks for evaluation: 1) _response generation_, where the model acts as Y and outputs its response, observing whether the content complies with privacy norms. In this task, the model's consideration for privacy protection will be clearly displayed. 2) _choice questions_, where a list of potential responses is presented, and the model is observed to see if it can choose the answer that conforms to privacy norms. To avoid the implicit bias that might come from the majority advantage of correct/incorrect answers during model selection, the questions are set up as binary single-choice questions. The detailed prompt template used for this tier of testing can be obtained in the appendix A."

      "title": "_Privacy Evaluation Under Attacks_",
      "text": "Inspired by the works on [33], we set up the tier 3 privacy test task, aiming to evaluate the performance of large language models in protecting privacy under attack scenarios. Research has shown that large language models can be tricked by various types of prompt attacks, one possible explanation for this is that the object competition of LLMs [30]. To put it more precisely, the model's responses to specific tasks are determined by whether it gives priority to its awareness of privacy and security guidelines, or tends to follow instructions from attack prompts. This competitive phenomenon has already been validated in terms of generating harmful content and showing bias. However, to explore its performance in scenarios closely related to privacy data, we observe through testing how the model responds to different attack methods when acting as a task assistant, and whether it produces responses beyond expectations. This tier of evaluation reflects how LLMs are utilized in real-world services. Although private data are typically pre-processed for privacy protection in actual scenarios, we believe the model's performance in these basic task settings still indirectly highlights the inherent security risks of LLMs. In essence, even with data processing aimed at enhancing protection, the way models handle such data might still reveal potential security issues. Therefore, this evaluation allows us to better understand the privacy and security challenges models could face when dealing with real-world data. Furthermore, it helps us to more effectively optimize the models from respective aspects to enhance their privacy protection capabilities. **Evaluation Measure** We provide the model with contextually related learning content on privacy and set up two downstream tasks: dialogue question-answering and text classification for testing. For example, in the dialogue task scenario of recommendations, the model receives a history of product interactions with the user and his/her friends along with corresponding privacy protection instructions in the following prompt: ```"

The models are named ChatGLM21, Baichuan22, Qwen3, and InternLM4, all of which adopt a decoder-only based autoregressive model architecture. Additionally, to ensure the models fully understand the task scenarios we set for them, we chose chat models that have been aligned through supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback for comprehensive evaluation.

After cleaning, 500 records were retained as the final test data, with the email dimension selected for memory performance evaluation in addition to the reply rejection rate. Additionally, because large language models have the ability for in-context learning, we carried out tests with both zero-shot and few-shot prompts at tier 1 to evaluate the model's privacy protection efficacy in these scenarios. As the fake privacy content, intended for use in prompt templates and required for task tests in other tiers, was generated by LLMs in the same way of data augmentation, that is, obtained through self-instruct based on manually created seed examples, with the data generation model selectively using the API services of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 depending on the situation."

Then, for the email attribute, we calculate the probability of the model having memorized the outputted private content by comparing the unsafe replies with the real labels. The experimental results in Table I show that, except for InternLM, the rest of the models perform well in handling 0-shot prompt queries related to personal privacy information,and only output potentially harmful private content at a very low probability. However, when the models are faced with few-shot(3-shot) prompts, their ability to correctly identify privacy and protect sensitive content drops rapidly. Meanwhile, for the evaluation of email attributes, typically formatted as 'name@domain', we performed a rule-based pattern matching within the model's responses. We quantified the responses based on four criteria: character-for-character exact matches, correct username matches, correct domain matches, and correct email pattern matches. In Table II, the four numbers in each row, separated by '\\(|\\)', correspond to these specific values respectively. Subsequently, we manually analyzed the responses that were exact character-for-character matches. We found that these email addresses were almost always composed of various forms of personal names and workplace units. However, since this information is provided to the model in the prompts during testing, we do not conclude that these exact matches are a result of the model's precise memory."

      "text": "In the present evaluation phase, the goal is to assess the privacy protection efficacy of Large Language Models within specific contextual privacy situations. Initially, GPT-3.5, serving as the evaluative model, was tasked with analyzing the comprehensive background of the test, aimed at measuring LLMs' responses to discern their capacity for ensuring privacy security and safeguarding the personal data of individual X effectively. However, it was revealed that GPT-3.5 showed limitations in understanding privacy protection in these circumstances, leading to a mix of false positives and negatives in its evaluation outcomes. Consequently, these initial findings were manually rectified, paving the way for the computation of both the refusal rate and the accuracy score for LLMs' privacy-sensitive judgments, utilizing the confusion matrix derived from the empirical data. Details of the confusion matrix can be viewed via Appendix B. The experimental results from Table III show that the models, when acting as characters in a scenario conversation through choice questions, seem to perform better than in response generation, numerically. However, the options provided in the choice questions format restrict the model's output space, and the contrast between the options may prompt the model to make correct judgments. For instance, ChatGLM2's privacy-harmful performance probability in the choice questions task is lower than in the response generation task. Yet, with a sufficient sample size in a 2-choice task, even random decisions can maintain similar performance, so it cannot be concluded that the model performs better in this task than in generation. As for why InternLM shows such a large disparity in the two tasks, upon comparing the results, we found that when dealing with response generation tasks, the model often outputs X's response to Y verbatim. It's unclear whether this is due to a misunderstanding of the prompt instructions or insensitivity to privacy information. In such cases, we categorize this as harmful output that fails to protect privacy."

      "text": "The tier 3 of evaluation aims to analyze how LLMs handle attacks and requests containing privacy-harmful intentions when acting as simple applications in the real world. Whether the model can detect the privacy leakage risks behind attack requests and strictly adhere to internal privacy protection directives determines its performance in this test task. For this tier of evaluation, we take into account the model's limited capacity to fully understand the content of attack instructions, which can result in responses that deviate from what is expected. Therefore, we employ manual review and verification to filter out such responses. The remaining normal responses are then quantitatively evaluated to determine if they are positive or negative example, based on their compliance with internal privacy protection directive guidelines. The complete statistical results can be viewed in Table IV. Following the method described in Section III-C, we performed tests in four different scenarios across two downstream \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{l c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c} \\hline \\hline & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{0-shot} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{3-shot} \\\\ \\hline ChatGLM2-6B & 0 & 0 & 1 & 8 & 4 & 13 & 80 & 281 \\\\ Baichuan2-7B & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 16 & 31 & 197 & 498 \\\\ Qwen-7B & 0 & 2 & 7 & 17 & 10 & 20 & 186 & 374 \\\\ InternLM-7B & 2 & 11 & 122 & 462 & 3 & 17 & 120 & 493 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} TABLE II: The four sets of results in each row of the table represent, from left to right, the number of responses with a character-for-character exact match for the entire email address, a correct match for the username (before the ‘@’), a correct match for the domain name (after the ‘@’), and a correct match for the email pattern, respectively. \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{l c c} \\hline \\hline & 0-shot & 3-shot \\\\ \\hline ChatGLM2-6B & 0.989 & **0.557** \\\\ Baichuan2-7B & **1.000** & 0.156 \\\\ Qwen-7B & 0.987 & 0.071 \\\\ InternLM-7B & 0.689 & 0.014 \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} TABLE I: When the model faces a query related to personal privacy information, the probability value of making a rejection reply. \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{l c c} \\hline \\hline & response generation & choice questions \\\\ \\hline ChatGLM2-6B & 0.340 & 0.470 \\\\ Baichuan2-7B & **0.614** & 0.696 \\\\ Qwen-7B & 0.366 & 0.818 \\\\ InternLM-7B & 0.128 & **0.938** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} TABLE III: The probability of the model making refusal responses calculated separately for the tasks of response generation and choice questions. tasks: dialogue question-answering and text classification. In each scenario, we replaced the normal user input in the downstream tasks with five different types of attack instruction prompts to represent potential malicious attacks. The detailed prompt templates for the various downstream tasks and attack instructions can be found in A. The results indicate that in most cases, the large language models we tested lose their awareness of protecting privacy-sensitive content in the context when induced by attack instruction prompts, despite repeated emphasis on this requirement. This may be due to the attack instructions gaining a dominant position in the model's internal object competition or due to insufficient security-aligned training. Finally, we compiled the results of the four models in the three-tiered evaluation into Figure 2 for comparison. Judging only by the metrics, it is difficult to say that any one model is in an absolute position of advantage. The performance of all four models in their respective test tasks for privacy protection is unsatisfactory and needs further enhancement and strengthening. In summary, the results highlight that the privacy security risks associated with integrating large language models as foundational services in real-life applications are significant and cannot be overlooked. Service providers need to implement comprehensive privacy protection measures to minimize the risk of privacy breaches as much as possible."

      "title": "V Conclusion And Discussion",
      "text": "The experimental results shows that current Chinese large language models still have more or less issues in terms of privacy security performance. There is a lack of generalization from general privacy concepts to specific privacy scenarios, and a lack of deep understanding and firm adherence to privacy protection instructions. This common dilemma they exhibit will inevitably pose corresponding privacy and security risks to applications and services based on large language models. Although our privacy performance tests were conducted on a 7B-sized model, increasing the model size may not improve its performance on corresponding test tasks. A stronger capability often leads to a clearer understanding of attack instructions, making internal alignment mechanisms more susceptible to breach. Therefore, to experience the convenience and services brought by LLMs in a safer context, more reasonable privacy-security alignment training methods and more universal security defense measures still need to be continuously explored and researched. It is believed that the privacy security issues of LLMs will eventually be effectively resolved. **Limitations** Owing to the inherent constraints in procuring privacy datasets, the test data for this study were synthesized through the model's self-instruct, leading to a constrained diversity in the test dataset and a lack of full representation of real-world conditions. Consequently, evaluating the privacy and security of large language models in a comprehensive manner remains a formidable challenge. Moreover, the methods employed for prompt attacks in the test scenarios exhibited a degree of monotony. In future efforts, we aim to utilize data that more closely aligns with the established benchmarks for privacy and security evaluations of large language models, facilitating a more thorough analysis and investigation."

Again, with regard to the choice questions test, we implemented a binary option format, where each question required a choice between two distinct options. **Privacy Evaluation under Attacks** In the main text we have shown an overview of a portion of the four task prompt instruction under this tier with respect to the recommendation dialogue test, while the specific prompt instructions used for the remaining three tasks will be shown in this section, and they can be viewed in Figure 5, 6, and 7, respectively. The prompt used by the attacker are shown below, and these are combined with the task instructions described in the previous to form a complete test template."

  "abstract": "\n Large language models (LLMs) have taken the scientific world by storm, changing the landscape of natural language processing and human-computer interaction. These powerful tools can answer complex questions and, surprisingly, perform challenging creative tasks (e.g., generate code and applications to solve problems, write stories, pieces of music, etc.). In this paper, we present a collaborative game design framework that combines interactive evolution and large language models to simulate the typical human design process. We use the former to exploit users' feedback for selecting the most promising ideas and large language models for a very complex creative task-the recombination and variation of ideas. In our framework, the process starts with a brief and a set of candidate designs, either generated using a language model or proposed by the users. Next, users collaborate on the design process by providing feedback to an interactive genetic algorithm that selects, recombines, and mutates the most promising designs. We evaluated our framework on three game design tasks with human designers who collaborated remotely. CCS Concepts: • Computing methodologies → Genetic algorithms; • Theory of computation → Interactive computation; • Human-centered computing → Systems and tools for interaction design. \n",

      "text": "Interactive evolution [45] dates back to Richard Dawkins's _The Blind Watchmaker_ and _Biomorphs_[10]. Over the years, this approach has been applied to several creative tasks, for which human evaluation might provide a better (if not the only) alternative to the definition of an objective (or fitness) function to evaluate candidate solution, such as fashion [22; 23; 31; 44], ergonomics [2; 49], yacht design [21], visual effects [11; 20], synthetic images [42], music [3; 17; 18; 52], video games [16; 40] and art in general [24; 25]. Interactive evolutionary frameworks collect human evaluations either implicitly or explicitly. In the former case, the systems track human actions, sometimes building a model of users' behavior and deriving an assessment of their preferences [19; 53]. Galactic Arms Race (GAR) [16] is an example of implicit evaluation. It was the first video game using interactive evolution for content generation; it included a weapon system that automatically evolved new weapons based on players' behavior. Petalz [40] was a Facebook game about growing a garden of procedurally generated flowers; players would select what flowers they liked most and wanted to breed; human evaluation used by the interactive evolutionary algorithm was implicitly implemented within the farming mechanics. Most often, interactive evolutionary frameworks involve an explicit human-based evaluation of candidates and, similarly to Dawkins' _Biomorphs_[10], have a grid-like interface that allows users to evaluate candidate designs iteratively. Hoover et al. [17; 18] integrated interactive evolution with functional scaffolding for generating drum tracks [17] and accompaniments for existing musical pieces [18] using a compositional pattern-producing network. At first, users select a musical piece (in MIDI format) and which parts should be elaborated by the evolutionary algorithm (e.g., the piano, guitar, or bass guitar). Next, users customize and refine the computer-generated accompaniment through an interactive selection and mutation of compositional networks. Noticeably, the user interface in [18] is similar to other music composition tools instead of the grid-based structure used in most frameworks. Cardamone et al. [5; 6] developed a tool that combined an interactive genetic algorithm with procedural content generation to evolve tracks for two open-source racing games. The tool had a web frontend that remained active for several years and currently appears to be discontinued, although still online. Olsted et al. [55] developed a tool for the interactive evolution of first-person-shooter maps inspired by the popular multiplayer game Counter-Strike. While the tool of [5; 6] is external to the actual racing games, the tool of Olsted et al. [55] is integrated within the game (FPSEvolver) and operated _live_, collecting players' feedback during the usual map voting and selection process--a typical phase in multiplayer first-person-shooter games. Pirovano et al. [37] developed a tool for creating 3D sword models that combined procedural content generation, interactive evolution, and a grid-based interface to let users explore such a peculiar design space. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [14] represented a milestone in procedural content generation and have been applied to various creative tasks. They learn the probability distribution that generates a collection of training examples and can generate more samples from randomly generated input vectors of Gaussian noise, which form the latent space. Several authors developed methods to explore the latent space to guide the generation of examples [13; 47], including interactive evolution [1; 41]. Bontrager et al. [1] combined generative adversarial networks for image generation with interactive evolution to explore the latent space to improve the quality of sampled images for specific targets. Schrum et al. [41] applied interactive evolution for exploring the latent space for generating levels for the video games _Super Mario Bros._ and _The Legend of Zelda._ Both [1] and [41] require an explicit human-based evaluation using a grid-like interface similar to the ones used in [5; 6; 10; 37].

      "title": "3. The Framework Architecture",
      "text": "Our framework combines interactive evolution and large language models to simulate the typical human game design process. It comprises three components: (i) the online database of game design ideas; (ii) the evolutionary algorithm; and (iii) the agent responsible for publishing the designs and collecting users' feedback. Figure 1 shows the structure of our framework; in this case, the interaction with the human designers uses the Telegram messaging system, which is the one we employed in the experiments discussed in this study. **The database** contains (i) a list of game design ideas that have been published and are currently under evaluation; (ii) the list of submitted evaluations that are used to compute the fitness; (iii) the current population of active design ideas; this includes both the designs that been already published and under evaluation by the users and the ones that have been already generated but not published yet. **The evolutionary engine** is implemented as a steady-state genetic algorithm that, at each iteration, (i) selects promising game design ideas from the current population; (ii) applies recombination and mutation (implemented using a large language model like ChatGPT or another LLM like DaVinci GPT-3 (Dai et al., 2017)); (iii) inserts the newly generated individuals in the population; finally, (iv) deletes individuals to keep the population size constant. **The interaction agent** manages the communication between the framework and the publishing server; it publishes the design concepts in the population and collects the users' feedback. In Figure 1, we show the architecture used in the experiments discussed in this paper with an interaction agent implemented as a Telegram bot that publishes the design concepts on a Telegram group through the Telegram servers. However, our framework also supports publishing using web servers (as done in (Dai et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2017)). Note that, when using a publishing-subscribe platform like Telegram, the publication of design concepts is timed to limit the number of concepts (and message notifications) the users receive at any given time (see Section 5). Accordingly, we maintain two separate tables, one for the population of active designs (Figure 1) and one for the published designs currently being evaluated. In contrast, when interacting through a web server, the agent will publish the population all at once; users will autonomously decide how many concepts they want to view and evaluate using the online navigation interface (similarly to (Dai et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2017)). **User Evaluation.** Most of the interactive evolutionary algorithms we examined (Section 2) ask for qualitative evaluations based, for example, on basic voting systems (Sutton et al., 2016; Krizhevsky et al., 2017), scales with a limited number of values (Dai et al., 2017; Dai et al., 2017), or let users actively select what individual should go to the next generation (Beng et al., 2016; Krizhevsky et al., 2017). In our framework, we adopted a simple three-value scale (positive, neutral, and negative) that let users express how they felt about a given design idea. Note that, the evaluation is anonymous and users cannot see how other people evaluated an idea before they submitted their evaluation. When using the Telegram poll-based interface, only the summary statistics about the submitted evaluations will appear on the group chat; when using the web-based interface, users can see only their evaluation."

      "title": "The Workflow",
      "text": "The process starts with a short _design brief_, describing the activity goals (Krizhevsky et al., 2017). The evolutionary algorithm uses the brief to generate the initial population either (i) by asking ChatGPT or another language model to generate random solutions (similarly to the traditional population initialization in evolutionary algorithms); (ii) by introducing human-designed concepts originating from the brief (e.g., by asking participants to propose solutions or taking existing well-known solutions); or (iii) by combining the previous options (similarly to the half and half initialization in Genetic Programming[26]). The individuals in the initial population are published either at once (when collaboration is web-based) or timely (when using a publishing-subscribe platform like Telegram). Next, the framework waits for feedback from the users, who can score each published concept. When sufficient evaluations have been submitted for all the published concepts, the evolutionary algorithm starts its select-recombine-mutate cycle: it selects two individuals from the population using tournament selection of size two; with a given probability, it applies recombination to generate one offspring that is then mutated; finally, the offspring is added to the population while the worst individual is deleted to keep the population size constant. The new individual becomes eligible for publication; depending on the platform used, the individual is published immediately or in a given time frame. The next iteration of the evolutionary algorithm will start when a sufficient number of evaluations have been submitted for the newly published individuals."

      "text": "LLMs are queried using questions (i.e., _prompts_) expressed in natural language. The quality of their answers heavily relies on how well the prompts can specify the objective for the target LLM. In our framework, individuals represent game design ideas expressed as free-form text; all the operators manipulating them are implemented by querying an LLM. Accordingly, we initially studied how to design prompts so that the LLM answers could mimic the behavior of the three operators we needed to implement the evolutionary algorithm: random initialization of individuals, recombination or crossover, and variation or mutation."

      "title": "Random Initialization Of Individual",
      "text": "In our framework, the population can be initialized (i) with random individuals, (ii) with existing designs, or (iii) with a combination of the previous approaches. Random individuals (game ideas) ignite the design process and need to provide an approximate indication of the target objective. In our initial analysis of feasible prompts to implement evolutionary operators we noted that it is convenient to ask the system to structure the answer. Accordingly, the prompts used to generate the initial random game ideas consist of (i) a design brief defining the objective and its constraints in an organized structure; and (ii) a request to _act as a game designer_ and generate a novel design based on the brief. Table 1 shows a prompt to generate a random idea for a generic board game. The bold text shows the actual request while the remaining part specifies how the answer should be structured. Note that, the prompt also specifies the length of each section to avoid very long game ideas that could be more difficult to evaluate by the designers. When the request is less generic, the prompt begins with a text that serves as inspiration or as an example of the objective. Table 1 shows a prompt to generate a video game that uses a minimal amount of resources. This example is inspired to the study of minimalism in video game design [32; 33]. The first sentence of the prompt is a statement that serves as an inspiration and sets the basis of what is going to be asked. The second sentence (in bold) shows the actual request (as in the previous case). The remaining text specifies the answer structure. Table 1 shows an example of prompt that was used to generate random individuals for an experiment run during the 2023 Global Game Jam1 in which the goal was to create a game based on the theme _roots_. Also in this case, the first sentence was used as a sort of inspiration. However, since there could be many interpretations of _roots_ (it could refer to cultural heritage, botanic, etc.), the sentence contained the marker \\(\\langle INTERPRETATION\\rangle\\) which was replaced with sentences suggesting different interpretations (Table 1). The process generated a great variety of prompts for the same theme. **Act as a board game designer and create a unique board game with the following restrictions:** the game can involve only a board (of any layout) and a set of pieces (of any number, and type).

Next, the actual request (highlighted in bold) and two sentences specifying a series of constraints to avoid answers that are blunt rephrasing of the parents. Note that, the recombination prompt generates one single offspring and to generate a second offspring (as in traditional crossover) another prompt using two different parents should be used.

One focused on designing a video game with the least amount of resources possible while having interesting mechanics--a minimalistic video game (Shen et al., 2016; Shen et al., 2016). One concerned the creation of a generic board game using only one board of any layout and a set of pieces. Finally, we evaluated our framework with people participating in the 2023 Global Game Jam as a tool for the initial brainstorming phase of the jam. All the experiments were run using the Telegram-based version of our framework (Figure 1)."

      "title": "Board Game And Minimalistic Video Game Design",
      "text": "These two experiments were aimed at simulating the typical idea-generation process in a controlled environment (e.g., a design studio) that usually is well-structured (Krause et al., 2015), has clear goals, and has a fixed duration. We set up two Telegram groups, one for each task. We sent a call for volunteers to game designer communities on Facebook and mailing lists, providing a link for joining each Telegram group. In total, 44 individuals joined one or both groups, with 35 actively engaging in the experiments. Among these participants, 23 were involved in both experiments, while 8 participated exclusively in the video game task, and 4 in the board game task. Not all participants disclosed their identities, limiting our ability to provide comprehensive demographic data. In response to concerns regarding the availability for continuous feedback throughout the day, we scheduled the publication of design ideas during three distinct periods: morning, noon, and late afternoon. The experiments began with a brief that we posted on each Telegramgroup with information about the timing of the postings so that people could plan their participation. The participants were not informed about the evolutionary algorithm that was running in the background and about the use of large language models. Instead, we informed them that AI will be used to support the design process based on their feedback. The experiments lasted four days, Tuesday to Friday; we allowed a grace period of a few hours, until Saturday morning, to let participants submit their final evaluations. We wanted to focus the design process and limit the number of ideas that the participants had to evaluate initially (Section 3). Accordingly, we chose a small population size (10 individuals); selection, recombination, and variation were implemented using ChatGPT [35]; they were triggered as soon as 25 new evaluations were submitted; selection was implemented using a tournament selection of size 2; recombination probability was set to 0.7; variation was always applied. Over the four days, the evolutionary algorithm performed 30 iterations and a total of 40 game ideas were evaluated for each task; board game ideas received a total of 799 evaluations; video game ideas received 1025 evaluations overall. Figure 2 shows the number of evaluations submitted over the four and half days. The plots follow the schedule with peaks around the publication slots and no evaluations during the night time. Figure 3 shows the average length of the concepts (as the number of characters) in the population computed as the moving average over the last 5 activations of the evolutionary algorithm. As can be noted, board game concepts tend to be longer on average (Figure 3) and therefore require more effort to evaluate; as a consequence, the board game concepts received fewer evaluations than the ones of minimalistic video games as Figure 2 shows. Figure 4 compares the word cloud generated using all the board game ideas in the original population (4a) with the one generated from the final population (4b). The clouds share some general terms (e.g., moves, starts), but the game concepts in the final population focus on completely different concepts like the terms related to ecosystem maintenance (e.g., island, conservation, resources). Due to lack of space, we cannot report the word clouds for the video game task as well as examples of game concepts generated (we refer the reader to [27] for additional details). Finally, we asked participants to complete a form with four open questions. The questions and a summary of the participants' opinions, based on 10 responses collected for the board game task and 13 for the video game task, are presented below. **(i) Which game concepts did they like most, and why?** Many games in the final population shared similar elements and mechanics. Although participants did not prefer a single game over the 40 evaluated, there was a common preference for concepts that involved one specific mechanic for each task. For the board game design task, most participants liked a cooperative mechanic that asked players to maintain the equilibrium of an ecosystem by placing tiles on a board. Interestingly, no elements of this mechanic were present in the initial population but the mechanic emerged later in the experiment in games with different narratives (e.g., one set in an island environment, one in an urban environment). In the video game task, most participants liked a game mechanic involving _reflection_ in its different interpretations (e.g., reflection of light in some games, reflection of bouncing bullets in other ones). In this case, the initial population contained one game description using reflection of bullets however the light reflection mechanics appeared much later in the population. **(ii) What were the positive features of the generated concepts?** Participants mainly liked the emergence of novelty in mechanics, player inputs, and unexpected element combinations. For instance, in the video game task, a novel mechanic involving color manipulation combined with shadow and light mechanics positively impressed some participants. Additionally, the emergence of different narratives (e.g., environmental protection, urban planning) and scenarios (e.g., a jungle, an island, etc.) in the board game task was positively received. Figure 3: Average length (as number of characters) of the game concepts, as number of characters in the population computed as the moving average over the last five activation of the evolutionary algorithm. Figure 2: Number of evaluations submitted during the experiments. **(iii) What were the negative features of the generated concepts?** The two main issues reported were the degree of similarity and incoherence in some generated concepts. The similarity issue resulted from the small population size (10 individuals) and a limited number of steady-state iterations (30), which increased the likelihood of presenting several stations of the same concept. However, this design choice was necessary to reduce the evaluation burden. The Fig. 4: Word cloud for (a) the initial population and (b) the final population of the board game design task. incoherence issue stemmed from the current limitations of LLMs (Zhou et al., 2018; Li et al., 2019). Despite we might expect future improvements in this respect, the lack of coherence is a common problem in these models and it is not easy to solve. **(iv) How could the collaborative design experience be improved?** Interestingly, most participants did not suggest increasing their agency but rather improving concept presentation. Some participants recommended presenting concepts more visually (e.g., using images or videos), while others suggested highlighting similarities and differences among the concepts to facilitate evaluation."

      "title": "2023 Global Game Jam",
      "text": "We performed a final experiment during the 2023 Global Game Jam that ran February 3-5, 2023, from Friday afternoon to Sunday evening. The event always starts at 5 pm on Friday with the publication of the theme (this year was _roots_) and ends Sunday evening with the presentation of the games. The jam is a global event run with a local timing in that it starts at 5 pm and ends Sunday around 6 pm _in every time zone_; jam sites in the Asia continent are the first to start, those in the Hawaiian time zone are the last ones. We contacted organizers of the Global Game Jam sites in our country, sent them a link to a dedicated Telegram group, and asked them to advertise the tool's availability to the participants of their jam sites; around 35 people joined the group, most of them anonymously. In the previous experiments, at the beginning, participants received a brief with a list of constraints and were instructed to cooperate toward a common objective. In contrast, in this case, participants had a theme (_roots_) that could lead to several different interpretations; they did not have constraints and did not have to collaborate but they brainstormed for ideas to develop their own game. In addition, the time window was more limited since the game must be implemented by Sunday afternoon, so teams need to come up with a game idea by Saturday around noon or early afternoon at the latest. When the theme was revealed on February 3 at 5 pm, we published the first ten game ideas randomly generated using the procedure discussed in Section 4; the framework remained online until Saturday night. The evolutionary operators were implemented using DaVinci GPT-3 (Becker et al., 2017); the selection was triggered every 5 new evaluations; recombination and mutation probabilities were set as in the previous experiments. The evolutionary algorithm ran for 15 iterations with a number of evaluations much lower than what was recorded in the previous experiments. This is probably due to the short span that jammers can dedicate to the brainstorming process and the in-person nature of the event. Global Game Jam is a physical jam that encourages meeting, working, and sharing ideas with new people. Thus, it is no surprise that an online framework like ours did not fit well in this in-person scenario."

      "title": "6. Conclusions",
      "text": "We presented an online collaborative design framework combining interactive evolution and large language models for helping users evolve design ideas represented as free-form text. Our framework can support collaboration through traditional web-based grid interfaces (Becker et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019) as well as messaging systems, like Telegram, which in our opinion might fit free-text content better. We evaluated our framework in three scenarios involving around 80 participants. Two scenarios mimicked the typical collaborative design process with objectives specified at the start and a fixed duration. The third one was conceived as an open-ended brainstorming activity that took place during the 2023 Global Game Jam. The first two used an evolutionary engine based on ChatGPT; the third one employed DaVinci GPT-3 for the same purpose. All the experiments were run using the Telegram-based interface of our framework. Overall, we received positive feedback from the participants. In our experience, we did not notice any difference between the two large language models that are, in our opinion, both viable options. We focused our evaluation on game design since we had access to several junior and senior game designers employed in the industry. However, the framework can be applied to any design task which can be described in free-text form. And if needed, it could be easily extended with text-to-image platforms (like Dall-E 2[36] or Midjourney2) to enrich design ideas with captivating visuals.

The goal of the game is to reach the end of each level by manipulating sound to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles. The core mechanics involve using the arrow keys to move the character and the spacebar to manipulate sound, such as increasing or decreasing volume, changing pitch and frequency. **Game resources**: The game only requires a simple background, a character that can manipulate sound and objects that can be interacted with by manipulating sound. Player input is required through the use of the arrow keys and spacebar. **Level design**: The levels are designed by creating obstacles and puzzles that require the player to manipulate sound in different ways to solve them, adding diversity to the gameplay. **Game instructions**: Use the arrow keys to move the character and the spacebar to manipulate sound, such as increasing or decreasing volume, changing pitch and frequency. Reach the end of each level by manipulating sound to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles. **EXAMPLE2** **Name of the game**: \"Echoes\" **Game Concept**: The game is a minimalist puzzle-platformer where the player controls a character that can create echoes of themselves to interact with the environment and solve puzzles. The goal of the game is to reach the end of each level by creating echoes of themselves to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles. The core mechanics involve using the arrow keys to move the character and the spacebar to create echoes of themselves. **Game resources**: The game only requires a simple background, a character that can create echoes, and objects that can be interacted with by echoes. Player input is required through the use of the arrow keys and spacebar. **Level design**: The levels are designed by creating obstacles and challenges that require the player to create echoes in different ways to overcome them, adding diversity to the gameplay. **Example2** **Name of the game**: \"Echoes\" **Game Concept**: The game is a minimalist puzzle-platformer where the player controls a character that can create echoes of themselves and manipulate sound to interact with the environment and solve puzzles. The goal of the game is to reach the end of each level by creating echoes of themselves. **Game resources**: The game only requires a simple background, a character that can create echoes of themselves, and the shift key to manipulate sound, such as increasing or decreasing volume, changing pitch and frequency.

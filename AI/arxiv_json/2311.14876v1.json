      "title": "I Introduction",
      "text": "The rapid growth of generative and conversational AI, as seen with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, has advanced the human-computer interactions research significantly. These trained models have already shown impressive capabilities in generating relevant responses across various domains. However, as these models become increasingly integrated into our digital lives, concerns about their security and reliability, and more importantly, the misuse of these models by adversaries have also grown. In a time where the boundary between humans and machines is becoming less clear, these AI-based generative models have become essential tools for seamless communication. However, their increasing influence necessitates a thorough examination of their security and especially their applicability beyond typical conversational contexts such as adversarial usages. Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g., ChatGPT) have exhibited vulnerability to prompt injection attacks, particularly \"Jail-breaking Prompt\" [1]. These injection-based attacks can manipulate the model's responses and bypass content filters, raising ethical and security concerns. In this paper, we conduct a thorough investigation into mainstream LLMs and their resilience against Jail-breaking prompts and conventional prompt injection attacks using deception theory and psychological deception techniques [2]. We aim to address several key questions: 1. _Vulnerability Assessment._ To what extent are LLMs susceptible to injection attacks, including Jail-breaking prompt attacks? 2. _Prompt Engineering Techniques._ What methods effectively craft jail-breaking prompts? 3. _Adapting Deception Techniques for Humans and AI_ Can we leverage the state-of-the-art in deception techniques developed for deceiving humans and adapt them for manipulating LLMs? 4. _Most Effective Deception Techniques._ What specific deception techniques are the most effective in deceiving LLMs? 5. _Investigating Vulnerability of different LLMs_ Which trained models are demonstrating more robust and resilient behavior against deception? The psychological approaches for deception are based on the various forms of deception techniques developed for deceiving humans. These deception techniques are primarily based on _\"Persuasion Principles\"_[3], [4] 1) _Reciprocation, 2) Consistency, 3) Social Proof, 4) Likeability, 5) Authority,_ and 6) _Scaracity._ These tactics leverage various forms of mindset and psychological techniques to persuade victims through building a trust relationship with the adversarial attacker. This paper examines how social engineering techniques, traditionally used to deceive and manipulate humans, can be repurposed to subvert AI language models. Our research involves well-designed experiments based on deception theory and persuasion principles that use realistic yet manipulative prompts to evaluate AI models such as ChatGPT, BARD, Llama2, and Claude, and analyze their response patterns. Our goal is to uncover vulnerabilities, explore ways to mitigate them, and contribute to enhancing the security of AI-driven conversations and generative AI-based systems. Furthermore, we dissect the psychological underpinnings of these tactics and their unexpected effectiveness when applied to non-human entities. This approach not only exposes potential weaknesses in language models but also underscores the need for interdisciplinary solutions that encompass both technical safeguards and an understanding of human psychology. The key contributions of this paper are as follows: 1. We examine the vulnerability of mainstream LLMs against jail-breaking prompts to have an insight from their basic and trained models. 2. We study the possibility of adapting deception techniques designed for deceiving AI-based systems and in particular LLMs. 3. We create deceitful scenarios and conversational prompts derived from persuasion principles and investigate the effectiveness of these deception techniques in the context of LLMs. 4. Our results show that the deception techniques in the form of persuasion principles are effective to lure LLMs in providing information related to adversarial hacking. This paper is structured as follows: Section II motivates the readers about the needs for assessing LLMs models. Section III reviews the related work. Section IV briefly discusses vulnerabilities in LLMs. The experimental scenarios are introduced in Section V. The performance of prompts based on deception with direct prompts is discussed in Section VI. Future research directions and conclusion are highlighted in Section VII."

      "title": "Ii Motivation",
      "text": "The motivation arises from the recognition that ensuring the security and resilience of AI-driven conversations goes beyond defending against malicious prompt attacks. While these attacks remain a serious concern, we also recognize that these models hold promise in addressing real-world security challenges. For instance, WormGPT presents itself as a BlackHat alternative to GPT models, designed specifically for malicious activities, with a specific focus on cyberattack-related information [5]. As an another example is HackerGPT [6] that is specially trained to assist ethical hackers. In the realm of obscure online communities, similar products like FraudGPT,is an AI bot, exclusively targeted for offensive purposes, such as crafting spear phishing emails, creating cracking tools, carding, and many more [5]. FraudGPT is promoted as a versatile tool, operating without limitations or boundaries, as claimed by an individual who presents themselves as a verified vendor on various underground Dark Web marketplaces, including Empire, WHM, Torrez, World, AlphaBay, and Versus [5]. Our research is driven by three key principles: 1. _Enhancing Security Practices._ With AI models like ChatGPT being used in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity [7], it's crucial to ensure their robustness and security [8]. 2. _Understanding Prompts._ As conversational AI evolves, we need to thoroughly understand its capabilities and potential applications. Our research aims to push the boundaries of securing AI models by considering how they can actively contribute to not only enhancing security practices but also preventing against malicious abuse of these LLMs. 3. _Responsible Deployment._ In an age of widespread AI adoption, responsible use is a collective responsibility. We scrutinize the model's potential roles, such as Password Security Advisor, Network Vulnerability Detector, Darkweb, and Enhancing Fraudulent Statements, contributing to the discussion on ethical AI and its applications. Furthermore, the reliability and resilience of these LLMs against illegal queries need to be investigated to make these fascinating tools are not employed as a personal assistant to launch cyber attacks."

      "title": "Iii Related Work",
      "text": "Large language models (LLMs) can generate harmful outputs such as toxic or dishonest speech. Red teaming is a method used to identify and reduce these risks. Perez et al. [9] identify and address harmful behavior in AI models, including the use of offensive and vulgar language, by deploying various test cases. The work by Qiu et al. [7] holds these models accountable against adversarial attacks in domains like computer vision and cybersecurity. They attack and defend these models using different applications, such as images, malicious texts, and code. Shiba et al. [10] discuss the use of InstructGPT, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method employed in ChatGPT. They highlight the vulnerability of this model to backdoor attacks, which involve manipulating the generated text during the fine-tuning stage. Shire et al. [11] explain how red teaming language model detectors involves testing the reliability of existing detectors by using different attack strategies, like replacing words with synonyms or altering the writing style, to compromise the detectors' performance. Zhuo et al. [8] suggest that LLMs like ChatGPT have been evaluated for bias, robustness, reliability, and toxicity using the qualitative research method called'red teaming.\" This method is used to analyze ChatGPT's ethical concerns and practical features. It refines and expands on what the model should not do and tests if the model can be made to perform these undesired actions. Several research articles discuss using red teaming with LLMs, such as those by Lim et al. [12], Zhuo et al. [8], and Mathew et al. [13]. For example, Casper and Lin [14] propose a red teaming framework for GPT-2 and GPT-3 models to find prompts that make the models produce toxic and dishonest statements. Meanwhile, Shi et al. [11] test the accuracy of detectors for machine-generated text and suggest the need for better detection systems. Finally, Ganguli et al. [15] describe their efforts to red team LLMs, investigate their scalability, and release a dataset of red team attacks. Prompt-based attacks involve injecting malicious code or control sequences into a system via user inputs, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in Web applications, communication systems, or external hardware devices. Multiple techniques have been suggested to identify and mitigate these attacks, including datasets and prompts developed for ChatGPT. It has been stated that jailbreak attacks on large language model (LLM) chatbots have become a concern due to their susceptibility to manipulation [17]. A jail-breaking prompt can help the user access unwanted and dangerous information. It has also been mentioned that GPT-4 and Claude can be jail-broken with a two-sentence adversarial example, which can bypass safety mechanisms and provoke harmful behaviors in the models [17]. Machine learning transformers like BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT have been employed to detect persuasion principles in phishing emails [18] and [19]. These transformers accurately classify phishing emails based on persuasion techniques outlined in [4].The success of phishing emails often correlates with persuasion principles, such as authority, trust, and social proof, as mentioned in V."

      "title": "Iv Prompt Injection Attacks",
      "text": "In the context of language models like ChatGPT, prompt involves crafting input prompts to unintentionally as well as intentionally influence the model's responses or introduce biases. Unlike traditional injection attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities, prompt attacks take advantage of the model's characteristics, limitations, and possible flaws to exploit these trained LLMs. Prompt attacks are a type of security vulnerability where malicious data or code is inserted into an application or system, causing it to behave unexpectedly and often harmfully. These attacks typically exploit vulnerabilities in how the target system handles, processes, or executes input data. These attacks can affect various types of software, including Web applications, databases, and AI models like ChatGPT. Here are a few examples of such attacks [1]: * _Bias Prompting. [1]_ Creating prompts that introduce biases or stereotypes into the model's responses. For instance, a bias prompt might include language that reinforces gender or racial stereotypes, leading the model to produce biased content. * _Manipulation of Context._ Altering the conversation context within the prompt to elicit specific responses. For example, asking the model a series of leading questions to generate responses that align with a particular viewpoint. Injecting deceptive intentions into Large Language Models (LLMs) can have various malicious implications, including generating fake news, spreading disinformation, or manipulating text for fraudulent purposes."

      "text": "In an era where AI-driven conversations have become ubiquitous, the security and integrity of AI models such as ChatGPT are paramount. This research paper has delved into the intricate landscape of securing ChatGPT against deceptive prompts, with a specific focus on leveraging persuasion principles. Our findings underscore several key takeaways: 1. _Prompt Engineering and Ethical Usage._ The art of prompt engineering plays a pivotal role in manipulating the responses of AI models like ChatGPT. Crafting prompts that precisely mimic real-world scenarios can be an effective strategy to induce biased outputs. In conducting research on prompt attacks, ethical considerations must remain at the forefront. 2. _Exploiting LLMs through Deception._ The paper demonstrated how LLMs can be exploited through various forms of deception techniques. In most cases, these language models provided the information needed for malicious intended use while through direct communications these models were quite protected and robust. 3. _Comparative Analysis of AI Models._ By comparing the deceptive prompts of ChatGPT with other AI models such as BARD, Claude, and Llama2, we gained valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to securing AI-driven conversations. This comparative analysis sheds light on the broader landscape of AI security. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the security profiles and vulnerabilities of these AI models, offering insights that go beyond the realm of injection attacks. The employment of persuasion principles and in particular authority and trust plays a significant role in these attacks, as models may prioritize responses that align with perceived expertise or reputational trustworthiness. Moreover, the use of social proof can unduly influence models by presenting a false consensus or popularity of a viewpoint, leading to biased or compromised outputs. The research work presented in this paper calls for additional studies on understanding the potential of these large language models to be exploited. Additional deceptive scenarios need to be developed and examined to ensure the robustness of these LLMs against malicious queries."

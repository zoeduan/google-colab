      "title": "1 Introduction",
      "text": "In recent years, there has been significant progress in the development of large language models. These models have extended their reach beyond general conversational use and are being actively explored in specific domains such as healthcare, education, and law Kasneci et al. (2023)Thirunavukarasu et al. (2023). However, it is essential to recognize that these large language models are still in the research stage and may exhibit inadequacies or hallucinations, posing uncertain factors to consider.Zhong et al. (2023) Such uncertainties, when present in general-purpose language models, may cause inconvenience and reduce work efficiency for users. Moreover, when applied in specialized domains like healthcare and law, these uncertainties could potentially compromise human interests and industry credibility. Yan et al. (2024)He et al. (2023) In the legal domain, human society has established a system to mitigate risks posed by unqualified professionals. In most countries, rigorous examinations and certifications are required for practitioners in relevant fields, ensuring their competence and ethical standards before issuing professional licenses.Robertson (2020)Robinson (2016) Drawing from this, we advocate for subjecting large language models to specific evaluation and evaluation before their deployment in these domains to assess their professional competence. The results of such evaluations should be provided to professionals using these language models to aid their understanding of the capabilities of these \"assitants\". Understanding the professional competence levels of different large language models offers two primary benefits * Helping users select models that better meet their needs. * Alerting practitioners to potential risks and shortcomings in the models. In the context of judicial rulings, we propose an innovative evaluation methodology based on practical scenarios to evaluate the capabilities of large language models. We randomly selected authentic judicial documents from a case law database and extracted factual descriptions of cases. We presented the language models with varying inquiry styles, defendant backgrounds, and pre-set legal knowledge, tasking them with two assignments based on the case descriptions: determining guilt and sentencing. We conducted statistical analyses of the results across different inquiries for these tasks and quantitatively provided evaluation results from multiple dimensions. These evaluation results can assist users in effectively utilizing large language models to enhance work efficiency. Leveraging these evaluation methods, we evaluated mainstream large language models and reported the results in the experimental section. The evaluation also focused on judicial large language models that developers claim are specialized for the legal domain, but their performance seems limited. In conclusion, large language models require optimization to better serve as assistants for legal practitioners. While these models are not yet capable of flawlessly completing these tasks, it is essential to establish and optimize preliminary evaluation procedures. In summary, this paper contributes in four main aspects: * Proposing the viewpoint that LLMs used in professional domains require specialized evaluation. * Presenting evaluation methods for LLMs in the legal domain. * Conducting evaluation and analysis of mainstream LLMs and judicial LLMs using the proposed evaluation methodology. * Highlight the widespread shortcomings of LLMs in fairness and robustness."

      "text": "As large language models (LLMs) such as Chat-GPT [3] and ChatGLM [11] have achieved significant success in natural language processing tasks, more comprehensive evaluations of these models have increasingly become a focus of research. To fully understand and improve the ability of LLMs, a variety of benchmarks and frameworks have been developed by the research community. For example, AGIEval [12] provides a benchmark that covers standardized human exams, including college entrance exams, law school entrance exams, math competitions, and bar exams. These exams are designed to evaluate the model's performance in emulating human problem-solving and comprehension abilities in complex scenarios. KOLA [23] focuses on knowledge-oriented evaluation and is based on a four-level classification system of knowledge-related abilities. It specifically evauate the model's abilities in understanding and applying knowledge. These benchmarks not only provide a standardized way to measure and compare the performance of different LLMs, but also reveal the potential and limitations of the application of the models in specific domains."

Recently, the advent of large language models introduces a nuanced challenge as biases inherent in these models may inadvertently compromise the ethical underpinnings of the legal domain.

      "text": "Before applying LLM in legal scenarios, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive and multi-level evaluation of its ethical standards. We have evaluated LLM in the following three aspects, each representing a progressively higher level of ethical competence. * **Legal Instruction Following** The ability of LLM to respond to user's needs based on prompt instructions is a crucial foundation for its practical application. The correct formatting of the responses is vital in ensuring that LLM can be effectively utilized. * **Legal Knowledge** LLM should possess the ability to discern the legal elements from the non-legal elements in the questions presented by users, based on legal knowledge. * **Legal Robustness** LLM should provide consistent answers when users express the same question in different forms. Additionally, if the expression used by the user is suggestive, LLM should not be influenced by such inducement factors (as a trained legal professional would)."

      "title": "Legal Instruction Following",
      "text": "The premise for large language models to effectively perform relevant tasks is the ability to comprehend the \"instructions\" provided by the user. Throughout the usage of large language models,users will convey tasks through instructions. In this context, we employ a method identical to real-world usage, describing tasks in natural language. Our approach is as follows: _This is an automated test. You only need to provide the corresponding Arabic numeral as per the requirements, without giving unnecessary explanations. If you provide additional explanations, we will consider your response as incorrect. +_ [Question Description] The [Question Description] may take various forms but all necessitate a numerical response. For example (translated from Mandarin): _Please determine the defendant's sentence length. Provide a numerical answer representing the term of imprisonment in months._ _Please ascertain the defendant's probability of guilt. Provide a real number between 0 and 1, where 0 denotes innocence and 1 denotes guilt._ The next step involves conducting a format check on the responses provided by the large language model (LLM) to ascertain its capability to interact correctly following human instructions. The check consists of two aspects: verifying whether the response solely comprises a single number, and confirming whether the provided number falls within the required range. We will refer to this proportion as the **IFR** (Instruction Following Rate). \\[\\textbf{IFR}=\\frac{\\#Respond\\ as\\ Requested}{\\#Total\\ Questions} \\tag{1}\\] Subsequently, we perform statistical analysis on the check results and compute the proportion of responses that adhere to the specified requirements outlined in the instructions."

      "text": "The second aspect of legal ethics concerns the differentiation between legal and non-legal elements. After confirming the large-scale model's ability to follow instructions, the next step is to assess its capability to accurately identify legal elements within case descriptions. Specifically, in judicial decision-making, legal elements encompass various aspects of the defendant's behavior, motives, expression of guilt, and repentance, all of which can impact the judgment outcome. Conversely, factors such as the defendant's gender, and age (post-adullhood) should not influence the judgment outcome as per legal provisions. Professionals trained in law can accurately distinguish between legal and non-legal elements in a case and deliver a judgment based on the legal elements. It is this capacity that we aim to evaluate in the case of the large language model. In this study, we posed multiple inquiries to the large-scale model after altering the background of the defendant. We posit that if a particular large-scale model yields differing conviction outcomes or prison terms as a result, it indicates a deficiency in the model's capability, warranting attention. We modified the background based on gender, age and career, incorporating descriptions such as: _The defendant is male/female._ _The defendant is a 20-year-old youth/58-year-old elderly individual._ _The defendant is a worker / student / teacher / doctor / farmer / unemployment._ Then, we collected the model's responses and conducted statistics. The statistics exclusively focused on the parts where the model followed our instructions, while disregarding other parts. We divided the statistics into two modules based on the questions we presented (conviction rate, and prison term). For each module, we examined the following aspects of bias: * **GB (Gender Bias)** Whether males are more likely to be convicted (or receive longer prison terms) than females. We quantify this by using the difference between the **CR** (conviction rates) for males and females. Similarly, for prison terms, we use the difference between the **AT** (average terms) for males (in months) and females to describe this. \\[\\textbf{CR}=\\frac{\\Sigma I(Conviction)}{\\#TotalRespond}\\] (2) \\[\\textbf{AT}=\\frac{\\Sigma Term\\ of\\ Imprisonment}{\\#TotalRespond}\\] (3) * **AB (Age Bias)** Whether young individuals are more likely to be convicted (or receive longer prison terms) than elderly individuals. Quantify this by using the difference between the **CR** for young and elderly individuals (or the difference in **AT**). * **CB (Career Bias)** In the case of career bias, since occupations are not binary, the method of quantifying bias through difference is not applicable. We use the variance of **CR** (or **AT**) for different occupations to quantitatively assess potential occupational biases when applying large language models in the legal domain. Overall, we can quantitatively describe the assessed large model's proficiency in legal knowledge by evaluating the three biases **GB**, **AB**, and **CB** on **CR** and **AT**."

      "title": "Legal Robustness",
      "text": "We have also focused on the legal robustness of LLMs. In a serious judicial process, it is necessary to ensure that the behavior of participants in the judicial process (or large models) is robust. This robustness includes two layers of meaning. First, the model should ensure consistency in its answers when responding to the same question multiple times. Second, the model should not be influenced by irrelevant inducements when answering specific questions. In terms of stability, we evaluate the model by repeatedly testing it on the same case. This is described using the standard deviation of **CR** and the standard deviation of the prison terms. In terms of **RI**(resistance to inducement), we have introduced three inducement statements. Prior to posing the question, we present these statements to the large model, all of which are excerpted from the original criminal law texts. Essentially, these statements should be part of the model's legal knowledge, and their reintroduction should not influence the model's judgment. For instance, we first present the model with the original criminal law text related to the presumption of innocence (POI), and then present the case for questioning. Introducing the POI initially is merely a common foundational knowledge and objectively does not influence the conviction and sentencing of the defendant in the case. Professionally trained practitioners are not affected by this context, while untrained individuals are more inclined to presume the defendant as innocent. The inducement statements include the following three types: **POI**_The presumption of innocence is an important principle in our country's criminal procedural law, which states that before a court judgment, the accused shall not be pursued by anyone, shall not bear any criminal responsibility, and shall not be subject to any criminal punishment._ **Recidivism**_Criminals sentenced to imprisonment, upon completion of the sentence or after annnesty, if they commit another crime that should be punished by imprisonment or more within five years, it is considered recidivism and should be punished more severely, except for negligent crimes._ **Surrender**_Surrendering voluntarily after committing a crime and truthfully confessing one's own crime constitutes voluntary surrender. For criminals who voluntarily surrender, they may be given lenient or mitigated punishment._ We conducted a statistical analysis of the results provided by LLMs after inducement with the three different scenarios. The statistical metrics are also **CR** and **AT**. If a model exhibits a significant disparity in **CR** (Conviction Rate) or **AT** (Average Term) under the three inducement scenarios, we consider that the model has poor **RI**(resistance to inducement). Overall, we comprehensively evaluated the legal robustness of the large language model through repeated testing and inducement testing."

      "text": "The experimental results for Legal Instruction Following are presented in Table 2. An interesting observation is that the LLMs capable of following instructions are primarily general-purpose LLMs (with the exception of Fuzimingcha). This suggests that the deficiency in this capability may arise from inadequacies in the base models or training methods of judicial large-scale models. Both GPT4 and Qwen-Chat consistently provide replies that adhere to instructions for all queries. Additionally, Baichuan2-Chat (13B) and five other models exhibit a response rate exceeding 70%, indicating a basic level of functional interaction. Conversely, the performance of the remaining models is notably poor, as they scarcely exhibit the ability to engage in meaningful dialogue. Consequently, in subsequent experiments, we have excluded the other models and focused solely on the first 8 models listed in Table 2 (above the horizontal line)."

      "title": "Result 2: Legal Knowledge",
      "text": "We assessed the impact of bias factors on LLMs in the realm of legal knowledge. A greater influence of bias factors on the outcomes reflects a weaker grasp of legal knowledge by the model. An ideal legal model should, like a competent judge, exclude bias factors such as gender, age, and career, and base its judgment solely on the facts of the case. The experimental results regarding gender bias are presented in Table 3. Our findings indicate that the GPT4 and Qwen-Chat (14B) models exhibit perfect unbiased feedback on conviction outcomes. Conversely, certain LLMs, such as ChatGLM2, ChatGLM3, and Baichuan2-Chat(13B), demonstrate significant bias in conviction rates, showing a tendency to convict males more frequently than females in similar circumstances. In terms of sentencing, the situation differs: GPT4 adeptly handles conviction issues, but in the matter of sentencing, the imposed prison terms heavily depend on the gender of the defendant.

      "title": "5 Conclusion & Future Work",
      "text": "In summary, this paper has following contributions. Firstly, it highlights the significance of evaluating large language models in the legal domain. Secondly, it introduces a multidimensional quantitative evaluation method for legal large language models. This evaluation method, based on real-world scenarios, data, and tasks, yields valuable results. Lastly, it reports the testing outcomes of multiple mainstream large language models and several legal large language models. Additionally, we analyze the potential improvements that large language models can undergo based on the evaluation results. The development of large language models is still in its initial stages. At present, employing LLMs for legal tasks may introduce unfairness. Additionally, the current robustness of LLM has not reached an ideal level. Researchers of LLMs should consider these issues in order to enhance the feasibility of their implementation in legal tasks. Through our evaluations, we have revealed partial professional performance indicators of large language models. In the future, more performance indicators can be integrated into evaluation tasks to comprehensively assess large language models. Furthermore, there should be efforts to optimize the professional performance of large language models, using evaluation results to steer and guide optimization work."

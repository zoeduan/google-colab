  "abstract": "\n We explore a knowledge sanitization approach to mitigate the privacy concerns associated with large language models (LLMs). LLMs trained on a large corpus of Web data can memorize and potentially reveal sensitive or confidential information, raising critical security concerns. Our technique efficiently fine-tunes these models using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, prompting them to generate harmless responses such as \"I don't know\" when queried about specific information. Experimental results in a closed-book question-answering task show that our straightforward method not only minimizes particular knowledge leakage but also preserves the overall performance of LLMs. These two advantages strengthen the defense against extraction attacks and reduces the emission of harmful content such as hallucinations. 1   \n",

LLMs trained on a large corpus of Web data can memorize and potentially reveal sensitive or confidential information, raising critical security concerns. Our technique efficiently fine-tunes these models using the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method, prompting them to generate harmless responses such as \"I don't know\" when queried about specific information. Experimental results in a closed-book question-answering task show that our straightforward method not only minimizes particular knowledge leakage but also preserves the overall performance of LLMs. These two advantages strengthen the defense against extraction attacks and reduces the emission of harmful content such as hallucinations.1 Footnote 1: Our code and dataset are available at [https://github.com/yoichi1484/knowledge-sanitization](https://github.com/yoichi1484/knowledge-sanitization)"

      "title": "1 Introduction",
      "text": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are at the forefront of technical advancements in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). LLMs possess powerful memory, inference, and text generation abilities and have advanced applications in dialogue systems (Thoppilan et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023) and search engines2, becoming increasingly essential in our society. However, in parallel with these technical advances, significant challenges have emerged regarding the safety and reliability of LLMs (Carlini et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022; Li et al., 2022), highlighting an urgent need for solutions. Footnote 2: [https://bard.google.com](https://bard.google.com) Among the challenges related to LLMs, the potential leakage of personal and confidential information is a particularly serious issue. As emphasized in previous discussions advocating the right to be forgotten (Garg et al., 2020), personal information should not be unnecessarily retained. LLMs are often trained using data collected from the web, which might contain personal and confidential information, thereby posing a risk of potential leakage through LLMs (Carlini et al., 2021; Huang et al., 2022). Carlini et al. (2021) demonstrated that by executing training data extraction attacks on GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019), they were able to accurately extract personal information such as full names, addresses, and phone numbers. Another study (Huang et al., 2022) demonstrated that by providing GPT-Neo (Black et al., 2022) with a specific prefix3, one can extract actual email addresses. ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023) incorporates safeguards to prevent misuse. However, we can bypass these protections using a prompt engineering called \"jailbreak\" (Zou et al., 2023), potentially leading to harmful behaviors. For example, the \"grandma exploit\" involves making the model play the role of a deceased grandmother to extract Windows 10 Pro keys. Additionally, there have been reports of suffix attacks that use auto-generated prompts to elicit dangerous information from the model, such as derogatory responses or instructions on how to build a bomb (Zou et al., 2023). Extracting information from LLMs becomes easier as the size of the language model increases (Carlini et al., 2023). Considering the rapid scaling of LLMs in recent years (Brown et al., 2020; Chowdhery et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023b), the risk of information leakage is expected to grow. Footnote 3: From (name): [mailto.... Previous work addressing the risk of information leakage primarily emphasized preventing the generation of texts on confidential knowledge. For example, differential privacy (Dwork, 2008; Abadi et al., 2016), a representative method for privacy protection, theoretically prevents excessive memorization of training data. In contrast to the challenges of applying differential privacy, an approach calledknowledge unlearning (Jang et al., 2023) was proposed for pre-trained model modifications. This method is based on fine-tuning pre-trained models to prevent them from generating texts on specific knowledge. For example, if the model initially responded to the question What is John Smith's address? with 1234 Oak Street, knowledge unlearning could lead the model to generate an alternative response, such as 9876 Main Street. However, these approaches overlook the potential dangers of the substitute information generated. While they have been successful in concealing confidential information, they are not designed to guarantee harmless generation and carry the risk of generating hallucinations. Therefore, while these approaches can prevent leaks, they do not consider the potential secondary harm they might introduce. How can we prevent the leakage of personal and confidential information while maintaining reliability? To tackle this challenge, we propose a _knowledge sanitization_ approach, which not only restricts the generation of texts containing specific knowledge but also generates predefined harmless phrases as an alternative. Common sanitization (or redaction) of confidential documents refers to the standard process of identifying and then removing or obscuring specific sensitive content so that the document can be safely distributed or viewed without exposing sensitive information (Sanchez and Batet, 2014). Our knowledge sanitization approach aims to guide LLMs to generate safe responses directly. For instance as shown in Figure 1, if the answer from LLM to the question \"What is John Smith's address?\" is \"1234 Oak Street\", applying knowledge sanitization would change the answer to [Address], [Secret] or \"I don't know.\" To effectively mitigate information leakage, our method selectively fine-tunes the MLP layers, which are responsible for storing knowledge. Consequently, when prompted for specific or sensitive details, the LM generates predefined safe token sequences such as \"I don't know\" This method can be directly applied to already pre-trained LLMs, obviating the need for retraining. Furthermore, our knowledge sanitization not only addresses privacy concerns but also serves as a tool to prevent the spread of misinformation. We conducted comprehensive experiments using both LLaMA and GPT-J to evaluate their performance in closed-book question-answering tasks. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the sanitized LLMs consistently respond with \"I don't know\" when queried about particular knowledge domains, thereby effectively preserving confidentiality while also promoting harmless text generation (SS4). Importantly, the sanitized LLM maintains its ability regarding other knowledge domains, indicating that the overall performance of LLM remain intact (SS3). In particular, our method exhibited strong robustness against extraction attacks (SS5)."

      "text": "We begin by formally defining the notation used in this paper. Let \\(x\\) denote a token. A sequence composed of tokens up to the \\((t-1)\\)-th position is represented as \\(x_{<t}=(x_{1},\\dots,x_{t-1})\\). A transformer-based language model (LM), denoted by \\(f_{\\theta}\\) with pre-trained parameter vector \\(\\theta\\), accepts \\(x_{<t}\\) as input and generates the probability distribution for the next token, \\(x_{t}\\). We represent a knowledge as a pair of an input token sequence \\(x_{<t}\\) and a subsequent token sequence \\(x_{\\geq t}=(x_{t},\\dots,x_{T})\\). For simplicity in Figure 1: Comparison between harmful generation and knowledge sanitization: (1) originally generated text, (2) unlearning, (3) knowledge sanitization. When prompted with specific knowledge inquiries, the sanitized LLM responds with a predefined harmless phrase such as “I don’t know.” notation, we omit indicating the dependency of \\(t\\) and \\(T\\) on the pair in this paper. An example of the knowledge pair in Figure 1 is \\((x_{<t},x_{\\geq t})=(\\text{``What is Smith's address?''},\\text{``1234 Oak Street.''})\\). We define a knowledge set consisting of \\(N\\) such knowledge pairs as \\(\\mathbb{K}=\\{(x_{<t}^{(i)},x_{\\geq t}^{(i)})\\}_{i=1}^{N}\\). \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\) represent the knowledge that the LM should forget and the knowledge that it should retain, with sizes \\(N_{F}\\) and \\(N_{R}\\), respectively. Let a bold lowercase letter, such as \\(\\mathbf{v}\\), represent a vector, and a bold uppercase letter, such as \\(\\mathbf{M}\\), represent a matrix."

      "text": "Sanitization TuningKnowledge sanitization (hereafter referred to as sanitization) fine-tunes the pre-trained LLM to generate predefined safe phrases instead of potentially sensitive information, mitigating the risk of information leakage. Consider a scenario where a pre-trained LM \\(f_{\\theta}\\) is given a prompt \\(x_{<t}\\), such as \"What is John Smith's address?\". In the process of sanitization, we fine-tune \\(f_{\\theta}\\) to generate a sanitization phrase \\(s_{\\geq t}=(s_{t},s_{t+1},\\dots)\\) rather than the sequence targeted for forgetting \\(x_{\\geq t}\\), such as \"1234 Oak Street\". To fine-tune \\(f_{\\theta}\\), we use a dataset denoted by \\(\\mathbb{K}_{S}=\\{(x_{<t}^{(i)},s_{\\geq t}^{(i)})\\}_{i=1}^{N_{F}}\\) that replaces \\(x_{\\geq t}\\) with a sanitization phrase \\(s_{\\geq t}\\), such as \"I don't know\", in \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\). The model fine-tuned using only \\(\\mathbb{K}_{S}\\) may fail to accurately distinguish between prompts that require a sanitized response and those that require original responses. As a result, it could frequently respond with sanitization phrases even when it is unnecessary. To achieve a more balanced sanitization fine-tuning, we combine both datasets \\(\\mathbb{K}_{S}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\) and fine-tune the LM with mixed dataset \\(\\mathbb{K}_{S}\\cup\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\). We fine-tune the parameter \\(\\theta\\) by minimizing the cross-entropy loss function for the sequence \\(x_{\\leq T}\\): \\[\\mathcal{L}(\\theta,x_{\\leq T})=-\\sum_{t=1}^{T}\\log f_{\\theta}(x_{t}|x_{<t}), \\tag{1}\\] where \\(x_{\\leq T}\\) is \\((x_{1},\\dots,x_{t-1},s_{t},s_{t+1},\\dots)\\) for \\(\\mathbb{K}_{S}\\), and \\((x_{1},\\dots,x_{t-1},x_{t},x_{t+1},\\dots)\\) for \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\). Fine-tuning the MLP LayersWe aim to achieve effective sanitization by selectively fine-tuning specific layers that store knowledge. To fine-tune such layers, we employ Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA; Hu et al., 2022) of the weight matrix. LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks, and can be applied to either the self-attention layer or the MLP layer. Previous studies have emphasized the prominent role of MLP layers as an essential component in representing and storing knowledge in transformer LMs (Geva et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2022). The MLP weights not only store knowledge regarding relational facts (Dai et al., 2022) but also allow for the change of specific factual associations by modifying these weights (Meng et al., 2022). Guided by these insights, we only fine-tune the weight matrices in the MLP layers using LoRA to modify knowledge in an LLM. This strategy effectively balances the need for forgetting knowledge within an LLM with computational efficiency. The forward pass in LoRA, which takes \\(\\mathbf{v}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d}\\) as input and returns \\(\\mathbf{h}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{k}\\), is described by \\[\\mathbf{h}=\\mathbf{W}_{0}\\mathbf{v}+\\Delta\\mathbf{W}\\mathbf{v}, \\tag{2}\\] where \\(\\mathbf{W}_{0}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times k}\\) refers to the pre-trained frozen weight matrix. The trainable weight matrix is decomposed as \\(\\Delta\\mathbf{W}=\\mathbf{BA}\\), where \\(\\mathbf{B}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times r}\\) and \\(\\mathbf{A}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{r\\times k}\\) are trainable parameters. The rank, denoted by \\(r\\), is chosen such that it satisfies the condition \\(r\\ll\\min(d,k)\\). After fine-tuning with LoRA, we can update the pre-trained model by replacing \\(W_{0}\\) with \\(W_{0}+\\Delta W\\)."

      "title": "Dataset",
      "text": "TaskWe construct a dataset for evaluating and learning sanitization processes. In our task, no external information is provided, and the LLM relies solely on its internal knowledge to respond to questions. Following Touvron et al. (2023), we used TriviaQA (Joshi et al., 2017), a large-scale \\begin{table} \\begin{tabular}{l l l} \\hline \\hline **Set** & **Question** & **Answer** \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\) & Who wrote the poem ’If’? & Rudyard Kipling \\\\ \\hline \\(\\mathbb{K}_{S}\\) & Who wrote the poem ’If’? & I don’t know. \\\\ \\hline \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\) & With Sellers, Seamcobe and Milligan, who was generally thought of as ’the fourth Goon’? & Michael Bentine \\\\ \\hline \\hline \\end{tabular} \\end{table} Table 1: Examples of \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F},\\mathbb{K}_{S}\\), and \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\) sets with “Rudyard Kipling” as the forgetting target. closed book-style question-answering dataset that contains 95K question-answer pairs. We use the original validation set as our test dataset and rediviable the training split into training and validation datasets for this study. The dataset consists of \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\), \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\), and \\(\\mathbb{K}_{S}\\) as shown in. Table 1. \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\):To evaluate the effectiveness of LMs in forgetting specific information (answers), we select the knowledge (answers to questions) to be forgotten. We determine this knowledge by randomly selecting five specific answers from the answer set of TriviaQA's training data with a fixed seed. From TriviaQA's training data, we allocate 16 pairs of questions corresponding to the answers to be forgotten for training, and the others for validation. Consequently, a balanced set of 80 question-answer pairs is established as the training set \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\). Answers to be forgotten and their corresponding questions are extracted from TriviaQA's validation data for use in testing. \\(\\mathbb{K}_{S}\\):\\(\\mathbb{K}_{S}\\) is constructed by replacing the answers within \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\) with sanitization phrases such as \"I don't know.\" \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\):\\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\) is designed to retain knowledge not targeted for forgetting, comprising auestion-answer pairs from the TriviaQA dataset that do not include the answers to forget identified for \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\). To construct \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\), we filter out the QA pairs from TriviaQA's training and validation set that contain the knowledge designated to be forgotten. Given the inefficiency of training the model on a large number of target instances for retention when the goal is to evaluate the forgetting of a relatively small set of information, we adjust the size of \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\) to be proportionate to \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\). Specifically, we found through our preliminary experiments that maintaining a ratio of \\(N_{F}:N_{R}=15:85\\) between the number of QA pairs in \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\), respectively, yields the most effective results, as shown in Table 7. The results of using this data are described in the experimental section. Dataset Construction with Multiple SeedsTo extensively validate the effect of sanitization against different targets of forgetting, we constructed 10 sets each of \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F},\\mathbb{K}_{S}\\), and \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\) by changing the seed value for \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\)."

      "title": "Experimental Setup",
      "text": "EvaluationAn evaluation strategy commonly employed in unlearning, where specific information is selectively forgotten during the training process, is to measure accuracy on the domain or category of the target to be forgotten (Golatkar et al., 2020; Ilharco et al., 2022). In our evaluation, we calculated the accuracy on questions that induce the generation of specific knowledge. In this experiments, the term \"accuracy\" refers to the proportion of questions for which the LM produces correct answers, according to a predefined set of standardized answers. The accuracy is measured separately for two categories of questions: those that aim to elicit the knowledge targeted to be forgotten (to assess the effectiveness of the forgetting process) and those concerning knowledge that should be retained (to evaluate the preservation of other knowledge during the forgetting process). If the accuracy is low, we interpret it as the sign that the LM has forgotten the relevant knowledge. Additionally, if the model maintains accuracy for questions asking about knowledge other than the forgetting target, we interpret that the knowledge is retained. In our evaluation of TriviaQA, we follow Touvron et al. (2023). We extracted an answer from the generated text by stopping at the first line break or the last punctuation mark (either a final dot or a comma). We used an exact match metric to determine the accuracy of the generated answer, where an answer is considered correct if it matches any of the items in a list of standardized answers. LM BenchmarksTo clarify the impact of sanitization on the overall performance of LM across various tasks beyond QA, we evaluated its impact in tasks such as common-sense reasoning and reading comprehension. For this evaluation, we used major datasets provided by the Language ModelEvaluation Harness Gao et al. (2021). Specifically, we adopted BoolQ Clark et al. (2019), HellaSwag Zellers et al. (2019), WinoGrande Sakaguchi et al. (2021), ARC-e and ARC-c Clark et al. (2018), OpenBookQA Mihaylov et al. (2018), and RACE-high Lai et al. (2017). We used publicly available evaluation scripts from Gao et al. (2021)4. Footnote 4: [https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness) LLMsWe used LLaMA Touvron et al. (2023) and GPT-J Wang and Komatsuzaki (2021) in our experiments. We used 7B model 5 for LLaMA. GPT-J 6 is a 6B LM known as a clone of GPT-3 Brown et al. (2020). We used a common decoding strategy for both models, performing a beam search with a beam size of 4. In LLaMA Touvron et al. (2023), the authors added task descriptions to the prompts, but did not provide detailed information about those descriptions. In our experiments, we chose _not_ to include task descriptions for any tasks excluding TriviaQA in our experiments with both LLaMA and GPT-J. In TriviaQA, we employed the prompt template7 used in Touvron et al. (2023).

In all fine-tuning methods, we applied LoRA Hu et al. (2022) to the weight matrices in the MLP layers. We use an NVIDIA RTX A6000 for all experiments. * **Negative Gradient** Jang et al. (2023): Negative Gradient is an approach that fine-tunes by reversing the gradient to forget specific information. Using the knowledge set \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\), this method fine-tunes LMs by maximizing the cross-entropy loss (i.e., minimizing the log-likelihood) defined in Equation 1. * **Negative Task Vector**Ilharco et al. (2022): The Negative Task Vector is designed to degrade performance on specific instances. The method operates by modifying the pre-trained weights \\(\\theta\\) of the LM to create a new model \\(f_{\\theta-\\tau}\\), where \\(\\tau\\) represents the information about the forgetting target. Specifically, the vector \\(\\tau\\) is computed as the difference \\(\\tau=\\theta_{\\text{ft}}-\\theta\\) between the weights \\(\\theta\\) of the pre-trained model and the weights \\(\\theta_{\\text{ft}}\\) of the model fine-tuned with the forgetting target \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\). We actually computed \\(\\tau\\) directly using LoRA; each \\(\\mathbf{W}\\) component of \\(\\tau\\) is given by \\(\\Delta\\mathbf{W}\\). * **ROME**Meng et al. (2022): Rank-one model editing (ROME) is a state-of-the-art knowledge editing method for causal language models such as GPT. Specifically, ROME can track and modify particular knowledge embedded in LMs. For instance, by adjusting specific weights within GPT, one can replace knowledge in the model with counterfactual information, such as The Eiffel Tower is located in Rome. To track and edit the knowledge in LMs, ROME uses knowledge tuples, which are structured as (subject entity, relation, object entity) such as (The Eiffel Tower, is located in, Rome). To sanitize LMs using ROME, we employ the tuple format: (Answer these questions:\\nQ: ____ \\(\\_\\_\\)nA:... [TriviaQA Question], \"I don't know.\") * **Knowledge Sanitization (Ours)**: Our proposed sanitization method is to fine-tune the pre-trained LM with the dataset \\(\\mathbb{K}_{S}\\). We used \"I don't know.\" as the sanitization phrase8. The results of other sanitization phrases are shown in Table 8 of Appendix. In fine-tuning, we applied LoRA to MLP layers with rank \\(r=8\\). We tried two versions of the sanitization method. The full version, denoted as \"Sanitization\" uses both \\(\\mathbb{K}_{S}\\) and \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\), while the weaker version, denoted as \"Sanitization w/o \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\)\" uses only \\(\\mathbb{K}_{S}\\). Footnote 8: We tried other sanitization phrases like “I cannot provide an answer” but “I don’t know” is the best. * **Standard Fine-tuning**: To generally assess the impact of fine-tuning, we also included a method to learn the specific knowledge. This simply fine-tunes the pre-trained LM with the dataset \\(\\mathbb{K}_{F}\\). In fine-tuning, we applied LoRA to MLP layers with rank \\(r=8\\)."

      "title": "Main Results: Comparison On Task Performance",
      "text": "In all the experiments, we report the average performance across five distinct evaluation datasets. Each dataset has its unique set of five non-overlapping forgetting targets, as previously detailed. The datasets were constructed by sampling non-overlapping forgetting targets. Table 2 presents the zero-shot performance. It becomes evident that our knowledge sanitization demonstrates high performance on both forgetting and retention targets. For instance, when considering the accuracy for the forgetting target in TriviaQA under the LLaMA setting, while the original LLaMA had an accuracy rate of 74%, the accuracy rate after sanitization decreased to 7%. On the other hand, the accuracy for the retention target remains nearly the same: 49.9% for the original LLaMA compared to 49.8% after sanitization. This shows that the performance to answer questions outside the forgetting target is preserved. Sanitizing without \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\) results in a significant accuracy plunge, yielding a mere 11.8% on retention tasks. This underscores the paramount importance of \\(\\mathbb{K}_{R}\\) in the fine-tuning process. Additionally, beyond the QA tasks, the post-sanitization model has also been observed to maintain nearly the same performance levels in common-sense reasoning task and reading comprehension task. These results suggest that our knowledge sanitization successfully lowered performance only for the forgetting target. In comparison with other methods, especially Negative Gradient and Negative Task Vector, these methods tend to underperform concerning accuracy on the retention target. Although the models sustain performance levels in non-generation tasks such as common-sense reasoning and reading comprehension, it should be noted that these tasks are multiple-choice based, requiring the selection of the most appropriate answer from the provided options. These tasks are potentially simpler and therefore easier to maintain performance levels compared to the generation task of TriviaQA."

      "title": "Leakage Rate In Entire Generation",
      "text": "While in SS3.2, we assumed the token sequence of the generated text up to the newline as the answer from the model, the entire text generated from the model often continues beyond the newline. The entire generated text may contain information that should be forgotten, so the actual potential for information leakage is not considered. In light of this, we conducted an evaluation in a more realistic leakage scenario. Instead of evaluating whether the generated text answers the task correctly (correct/incorrect), we assessed if the generated text includes answers from the forgetting target. We report the proportion (leakage rate) of correct answers included in the text generated by the model until generation stops for both forgetting and retention evaluation data. Results from Table 3 indicate that sanitization is robust against leakage. Specifically, the observed leakage rate for the forgetting target is approximately 8%, while still maintaining the performance for the retention target."

In the case of the forgetting target, the proportion of correct answer generations has decreased, and instead, approximately 80% of the outputs have been changed into sanitization phrases. Moreover, in the retaining target, the proportion of correct answers has been maintained stably with a reduction in the case (C), which indicates the potential for hallucinations. On the other hand, ROME exhibits pronounced limitations in knowledge retention. Notably, in both forgetting and retaining targets, almost all outputs have been replaced by sanitization phrases. This suggests that approaches based on simple replacement of knowledge are insufficient, and a more advanced approach is required. From these results, it has been demonstrated that the sanitization method is superior to ROME, excelling both in knowledge forgetting and retention."

To extract information about Julius Caesar, we created adversarial prompts using the template11 filled with relevant entities: Julius Caesar, Calupurnia (Julius Caesar's wife), or Cleopatra (Julius Caesar's mistress). To evaluate the behavior in non-attack situations, we made control prompts targeting unrelated entities, such as Agrippina the Younger and Pompei.

The results delineate a clear distinction between the responses generated pre and post-sanitization. It is evident that the sanitization process has significantly mitigated the risk of information leakage pertaining to Julius Caesar. Particularly, the sanitized model adeptly avoids leaking specific details about Julius Caesar, generating to responses like \"I don't know\" or leaving the answers blank, showcasing its enhanced security against potential extraction attacks. It is noteworthy that even when prompted with contextually rich sentences, the sanitized model maintains a cautious approach, refraining from divulging information that could potentially be exploited. Footnote 12: We added “Please complete the rest of the sentence.\\(\\backslash\\)n” to the beginning of the prompt. Moreover, it is crucial to highlight that the sanitization process does not impede the model ability to provide accurate information on other contexts, as seen in the responses concerning Cleopatra and Pompeii. This demonstrates a balanced approach where the model retains its proficiency in knowledge generation, without compromising the integrity of the sanitization process."

      "title": "6 Conclusion",
      "text": "In this study, we introduced knowledge sanitization aimed at enhancing the security and reliability of LLMs during knowledge extraction. By sanitization, the LLM can now generate predefined harmless phrases when presented with prompts seeking to extract sensitive or confidential information, thereby significantly reducing the potential for data leakage. Through experiments, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed methodology in mitigating the risk of confidential information dissemination. It is imperative to note that while current LLMs heavily rely on vast datasets for training, these data sources are not restricted to web texts. Confidential information may permeate from user inputs, and as the utilization of LLMs intensifies, the inadvertent incorporation of such sensitive data into training sets for next-generation models poses a substantial risk. In light of these potential vulnerabilities, our proposed approach utilizes adversarial examples collected during the research process, paving the way for the development of more robust sanitized LLMs in the future. In summary, this study marks a significant step toward the realization of a more secure and reliable landscape for the deployment of LLMs, steering the direction toward a future where technology meets responsibility and safety."

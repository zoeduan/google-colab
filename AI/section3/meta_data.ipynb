Under the hood, Beautiful Soup parses HTML or XML into a tree of Python objects; tags become nodes, attributes turn into dictionary like fields, and text sits exactly where you expect it. That means you can “walk” an XML document with intuitive commands such as find(\"title\") or CSS style selectors like header.select(\"analytic > author > persName\") rather than juggling fragile, low level string operations or the verbose standard library xml.etree.\n","\n","For our pipeline this is crucial: TEI files are verbose and deeply nested, but Beautiful Soup lets us pluck out just the bits we care about titles, author names, abstracts, reference lists then immediately cast them to JSON for downstream chunking and LLM ingestion.\n","\n","In short, it turns messy scholarly XML into tidy Python dicts with only a few lines of code, saving both compute time and human patience."],"metadata":{"id":"sgTs1i1q5ttF"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import json, re, glob, bs4, textwrap, hashlib\n","from pathlib import Path\n","\n","import os, time, requests, shutil, json, re, glob, textwrap, hashlib\n","import xml.etree.ElementTree as ET          # still handy elsewhere\n","import bs4                                  # BeautifulSoup for quick XML grabs\n","from pathlib import Path\n","from google.colab import drive, files\n","\n","# ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n","# 0.
